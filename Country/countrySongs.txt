Alan Jackson - Monday Morning Church
You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
'Cause I can't seem to talk to God without yelling anymore
And when I sit at your piano
I can almost hear those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid

You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith and now it only hurts
And I can heart the devil whisper
Things are only getting worse
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
'Cause the faithful man that you loved
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground

You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith and now it only hurts
And I can heart the devil whisper
Things are only getting worse
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
I still believe in Heaven
And I'm sure you've made it there
But as for me without your love, girl
I don't have a prayer

You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith and now it only hurts
And I can heart the devil whisper
Things are only getting worse
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
Alan Jackson - Remember When
Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when
Remember when we vowed the vows
and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when
Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when
Remember when the sound of little feet
was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give up
Remember when
Remember when thirty something seemed old
Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are,
where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when
Remember when
Remember when
Alan Jackson - The Talkin' Song Repair Blues
The mechanic raised up from under my hood
He shook his head and said, 'This ain't good
Your timin' belt's done, shrunk one size too small
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And your main prodsponder's nearly gone
Your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all.'
'The torque converter's runnin' low on torque
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
But we caught it all in time so you're in luck'
He said, 'I've got the time and I've got the parts
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
I think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks.'
But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
Then he said, 'Ain't you that songwriter guy?'
I said, 'Yes, I am,' he said, 'So am I.'
And he sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
When he finished singin' he gave me a smile
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
And he said, 'What do you think? Now don't hold nothin' back.'
Well, I gave him my most sorrowful look
And I said, 'This song's got a broken hook
I can order you a new one from Nashville but it won't be cheap
And I know you've been using a cut-rate thesaurus
'Cause your adverbs have backed up into your chorus
Now your verse is runnin' on verbs that are way too weak.'
But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
And I said, 'Hold on friend now I'm not through
I hate to be the one to give you the news.
But your whole melodic structure's worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
I mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you.'
And you've got a bad safety problem with
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over there and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
I can straighten this thing out for eig...nine hundred bucks.'
But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long
You guessed it
It may be a hit
I like it
Alan Jackson - Too Much of a Good Thing
Smiles in the morning as warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night
And two loving arms to console me
I should be scared it's so right
But too much of a good thing, is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And too much of a good thing, is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on
You look in my eyes and see my thinkin
I know when you're happy, when you're sad
Some would say it's too perfect
But I don't think what we have is so bad
Cause too much of a good thing, is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And too much of a good thing, is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on
Yeah, we've got a good thing going on
Alison Krauss - How's The World Treating You
(James Taylor
Alison Krauss)
I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you
Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
Tho' our pathways have parted
To your memory I'm true
Guess I'll stay broken hearted
How's the world treating you
Do you wonder about me
Like I'm hoping you do
Are you lonesome without me
Have you found someone new
Are you burning and yearning
Do you ever get blue
Do you think of returning
How's the world treating you
Alison Krauss - Restless
Honey, I know you've been alone some,
Why don't you 'phone some, 'cause I love you.
An' honey, I know I've been away some,
I've had to pay some and you have too.
But the one thing I know: that when I, I turn out the light,
Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.
I've been put down, pushed around, every hand even led down town.
An' I can't help it if I'm out of sight,
'Cause I'm restless tonight.
I just can't stand bein' alone.
Gonna have to change that some day.
Get a restless feelin' in my bones an' I know,
That at times, it just won't go away.
So if it's all the same, honey, I can't take the blame, baby,
I can't play your game, honey, what's true is true.
And if, in the end, the temptation wears you thin, honey,
I'll, I'll just pretend that I'll leave it up to you.
But the one thing I know: that when I, I turn out the light,
Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.
I've been put down, pushed around, every hand even led down town.
Can't help it if I'm full of fire.
But the one thing I know: that when I, I turn out the light,
Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.
I've been put down, pushed around, every hand even led down town.
An' I can't help it if I'm out of sight,
'Cause I'm restless tonight.
Alison Krauss - When You Say Nothing At All
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best, when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mister Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best, when you say nothing at all
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best, when you say nothing at all
Amber Dotson - I'll Try Anything
I can
t stand the smell of smoke
But I bought myself a pack
Bummed a light from a stranger
Nearly choked from that first drag
And I hate the taste of whiskey
And this barroom ain
t my style
But I
ll try anything not to hurt for a while
Seems like forever since I looked
into the eyes of another man
In my lifetime I
ve never known a one-night stand.
Lord knows it
s wrong to let a stranger
turn out your bedroom light.
But I
ll try anything not to hurt for a while
I
m tired, so tired of crying
Tired of reaching for a memory in the middle of a night
So sick of pain running through my veins overtaking my whole life
I
ll try anything not to hurt for a while
I
ll try anything not to hurt for a while
It ain
t like me to be a cussin
Getting tore up in this bar
Guess a good ole girl can backslide
Running from a broken heart
I pray the good Lord ain
t a lookin
And taking notes on me tonight
Cause I
ll try anything not to hurt for a while
I
m tired, so tired of crying
Tired of reaching for a memory in the middle of a night
So sick of pain running through my veins overtaking my whole life
I
ll try anything not to hurt for a while
I
m tired, so tired of crying
Tired of reaching for a memory in the middle of a night
So sick of pain running through my veins overtaking my whole life
I
ll try anything not to hurt for a while
I
ll try anything not to hurt for a while
Amy Dalley - Men Don't Change
He was a bad boy and I was a good girl
He needed me to smooth out the edges
He'd get his drink on and flirt with the ladies
After two years of his crap I quit begging
I'm a magnet for the fixer upper man
If I know it's fire, why do I let it burn my hand
Cupid works for the devil
Be suspicious if he cries
You know sex is usually good
Yeah, but it ain't always right
Chocolate is a band-aid and no matter what they say
Shoes don't stretch and men don't change
My friend Lisa, she loves a liar
She found about his other girlfriends
He makes excuses so she forgives him
She swears she's gonna leave if he screws up again
But he's good looking, that's why she don't see
He's got her exactly where he wants her to be

I just met a brand new guy
So far so good
iIhope he don't change at all

Andy Griggs - If Heaven
If Heaven was an hour, it would be twilight,
When the fireflies start their dancin' on the lawn;
An' supper's on the stove and Mamma's laughin',
And everybodys workin' day is done.
If Heaven was a town, it would be my town,
Oh, on a summer day in 1985.
An' everything I wanted was out there waitin',
And everyone I loved was still alive.
Don't cry a tear for me, now, baby;
There comes a time we all must say goodbye.
And if that's what Heaven's made of,
You know, I, I ain't afraid to die.
If Heaven was a pie, it'd be cherry,
So cool and sweet an' heavy on the tongue.
An' just one bite would satisfy your hunger,
An' there'd always be enough for everyone.
If Heaven was a train, it sure would be a fast one,
That could take this weary traveller around the bend.
If Heaven was a tear, it'd be my last one,
An' you'd be in my arms again.
Don't cry a tear for me, now, baby;
There comes a time we all must say goodbye.
And if that's what Heaven's made of,
You know, I, I ain't afraid to die.
Yeah, if that's what Heaven's made of,
You know, I, I ain't afraid to die.
Andy Griggs - She Thinks She Needs Me
She thinks I walk on water
She thinks I hung the moon
She tells me every mornin'
They just don't make men like you
She thinks I've got it together
She swears I'm as tough as nails
But I dont have the heart to tell her
She don't know me that well

She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss
Without her touch
Without her faithful lovin' arms
She don't know that its all about her
She don't know I cant live without her
She's my world she's my everything
And she thinks she needs me
Sometimes she cries on my shoulder
When she's lyin next to me
But she don't know that when I hold her
That she's really holdin' me
Holdin me

She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss
Without her touch
Without her faithful lovin' arms
She don't know that its all about her
She don't know I cant live without her
She's my world she's my everything
And she thinks she needs me
And the funny thing is
She thinks she's the lucky one

She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss
Without her touch
Without her faithful lovin' arms
She don't know that its all about her
She don't know I cant live without her
She's my world she's my everything
And she thinks she needs me
She thinks I walk on water
She thinks I hung the moon
Andy Griggs - This I Gotta See
I cant count the barns Ive passed
Painted red, white and black
See Rock City
And up ahead theres a turn
Takes me right through Gadlinburg
I hear its pretty
Maybe some other time, I cant slow down
Right across that state line, right about now
Her hair still wet from her bath
She's sitting on the front porch with a glass of iced tea
In my sweatshirt, in her barefeet, this I gotta see
If I hurry I can catch
The colors on her skin from that sunset
Her face and that look waitin on me, this I gotta see.
I cant wait to get to her, man
I wish I were there already
Shes the only thing that keeps this world from driving me crazy
I just hit that city limit
Yeah, thats a pretty good sign
And if I pick it up a bit, Ill be right on time
Her hair still wet from her bath
She's sitting on the front porch with a glass of iced tea
In my sweatshirt, in her barefeet, this I gotta see
If I hurry I can catch
The colors on her skin from that sunset
Her face and that look waitin on me, this I gotta see.

Rich - Holy Water
Somewhere there's a stolen halo
I use to watch her wear it well
Everything would shine wherever she would go
But looking at her now you'd never tell
Someone ran away with her innocence
A memory she can't get out of her head
I can only imagine what she's feeling
When she's praying
Kneeling at the edge of her bed
And she says take me away
And take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me like holy water
Holy water
She wants someone to call her angel
Someone to put the light back in her eyes
She's looking through the faces
The unfamiliar places
She needs someone to hear her when she crys
And she says take me away
And take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me like holy water
Holy water
She just needs a little help
To wash away the pain she's felt
She wants to feel the healing hands
Of someone who understands
And she says take me away
And take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me
And she says take me away
And take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me like holy water
Holy water

Rich - Save A Horse, Ride A Cowboy
(intro)
DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAAAAA
DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAAAA!
Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of crown
And everybody's getting down
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same.

Cause I saddle up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling- Blanging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town
And I saddle up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
(Spoken:)
I'm a thourough-bred
that's what she said
in the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road.
We where flying high
Fining, whine, having ourselves a good and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go.
But her evaluation
of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for slavation
all night long
So I took her out kicking frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love
And I saddled up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
What? What?
Save A Horse Ride A Cowboy
Everybody says
Save a Horse Ride a cowboy.

Rich - Wild West Show
I'm feelin' like Tonto,
Ridin' a Pinto,
Tryin' to chase the Lone Ranger down.
I'm a little unravelled,
But I'm still in the saddle,
Cryin' your name out to the crowds,
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!
Why don't you meet me,
Back at the tepee?
We'll lay down by the camp fire.
There, in the dark night,
We'll smoke the peace pipe,
Forget about who's wrong or right.
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!
Yeah, it was a big showdown,
Oh yeah, we stood our ground.
Shot out the lights:
It got a little crazy.
I don't wanna see us go,
The way of the buffalo:
Don't wanna have another wild west show.
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!
Only forgiveness,
Will finally end this.
There won't be a witness if we both fall.
There's never a hero,
In a battle of egos.
There's never a winner of the quick draw.
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!
Yeah, it was a big showdown,
Oh yeah, we stood our ground.
Shot out the lights:
It got a little crazy.
Don't wanna see us go,
The way of the buffalo:
Don't wanna have another wild west show.
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!
It's like a ghost town,
Without you around.
Why can't we just forget it,
Ride off in the sunset?
It was a big showdown,
Oh yeah, we stood our ground.
Shot out the lights:
It got a little crazy.
I don't wanna see us go,
The way of the buffalo:
Don't wanna have another wild west show.
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!
I'm feelin' like Tonto,
Ridin' a Pinto,
Tryin' to chase the Lone Ranger down.
Bill Engvall - Here's Your Sign Christmas
I took my son to the mall the other day to see Santa Claus
The woman in line behind me says
hey is that Santa Claus up there
?
I said
no ma'm, it's a Kenny Rodgers stunt double
Here's your sign
The other day I bought a wreath to go on our front door
as I was walking out the store a man stopped me and said
hey, are you going to hang that on your door
?
I said
no sir, it's a Christmas toilet seat cover, got the idea from Martha Stewart

Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
You acted dumb, so have some fun and wear your stupid sign
Oh! Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
you lost your mind, so pay the fine and wear your stupid sign
I hung those little Christmas lights on my house, you know the kind that blink on and off
My neighbour comes over and says
Bill how do you get those to blink on and off like that
?
I said
I've got my son inside plugging and unplugging it, plugging and unplugging it
Here's your sign
I took my family to buy a Christmas tree the other night
When we walked onto the lot this guy walked up to me and says
hey, y'all here to buy a Christmas tree?
I said,
no sir, my son needs to go to the bathroom and these trees looked really inviting

Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
You acted dumb, so have some fun and wear your stupid sign
Oh! Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
you lost your mind, so pay the fine and wear your stupid sign
Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
have no fear when you're spreading cheer during Christmas time
The other night my family and I were walking through the neighbourhood looking at all the Christmas decorations
when we came across this house that had a manger scene
now there was this whole group of people looking at it when I overheard this one guy say
hey, are those the Three Wise Men
?
I said
no sir that's ZZ Top doing a farming concert

Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
You acted dumb, so have some fun and wear your stupid sign
Oh! Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
you lost your mind, so pay the fine and wear your stupid sign
Here's your sign, Here's your sign, here's your stupid sign
(have no fear when you're spreading cheer during Christmas time)
And finally my wife and I were in a grocery store the other day and I heard a woman ask the clerk
do you know what time Midnight Mass starts on Christmas Eve
?
And in the holiday spririt I walked over and said
Here's your sign
Happy holidays everybody!
Billy Currington - I Got A Feelin'
I don't wanna rush this thing
I don't really wanna jump the gun
I really wanna say those three little words
But I'm gonna bite my tongue
Yeah, I'm just gonna lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
Till the right time comes down the road
Chorus:
I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an
I
And ends with a
U
I got a feelin'
Are you feelin' it too
I guess I've all but said it now
So much for hopin' you'd go first
Don't leave me hangin' out here on a line
Baby, it's your turn
Say you could sleep last night
Swore that you could feel me breathe
Had you wantin' me right there by your side
Yeah, baby I know what you mean
Second Chorus:
I got a feelin'
My heads a reelin'
My heart is screemin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an
I
And ends with a
U
I get a feelin'
You're feelin' it too
Bottle up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an
I
And ends with a
U
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too
You're feelin' it too
Yeah, you're feelin' it too
Feelin' it too
Oh, Yeah
Billy Currington - Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right
A woman is a mystery
A man just cant understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
N' Other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong
*Chorus*
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
N' Lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need to eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right
Anywhere you wanna go
Baby show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm whatever you say
Tonight's about givin' you what you want
Whatever it takes
Girl I hope i'm on the right road
Judgin by the smile on your face
*Chorus*
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
N' Lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need to eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right
*Chorus*
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
N' Lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need to eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right
Billy Currington - Walk a Little Straighter
I remember looking up
To look up to him
And I remember most the time
He wasn
t there
I
d be waiting at the door
When he got home at night
He
d pass me by to go to pass out in his chair
And I
d say
Walk a little straighter daddy
You
re swaying side to side
You
re footsteps make me dizzy
And no matter how I try
I keep tripping and stumbling
If you
d look down here you
d see
Walk a little straighter daddy
You
re leading me
He stumbled in the gym
On graduation day
And I couldn
t help but feel
So ashamed
And I wasn
t surprised a bit
When he didn
t stay
He stumbled out before they called my name
And I thought
Walk a little straighter daddy
You
re swaying side to side
It
s not just me who
s watching
you
ve caught everybody
s eye
And you
re tripping and stumbling
and even though I
ve turned 18
Walk a little straighter daddy
You
re still leading me
The old mans still like he always was
But I love him anyway
If I
ve learned one thing from him
Its my kids will never have to say
Walk a little straighter daddy
You
re swaying side to side
You
re footsteps make me dizzy
And no matter how I try
I keep tripping and stumbling
if you
d look down here you
d see
Walk a little straighter daddy
You
re leading me
Yeah walk a little straighter daddy
You
re leading me
Billy Dean - Let Them Be Little
I can remember when you fit in the palm of my hand
Felt so good in it, no bigger than a minute
How it amazes me, you're changing with every blink
Faster than a flower blooms they grow up all too soon
So let them be little 'cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give them praise, give them love every day
Let them cry, let them giggle, let them sleep in the middle
Oh just let them be little
I've never felt so much in one little tender touch
I live for those kisses, prayers and your wishes
Now that you're teaching me things only a child can see
Every night while we're on our knees all I ask is please
Let them be little 'cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give them praise, give them love every day
Let them cry, let them giggle, let them sleep in the middle
Oh just let them be little
So innocent, a precious soul, you turn around
It's time to let them go
So let them be little 'cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give them praise, give them love every day
Let them cry, let them giggle, let them sleep in the middle
Oh just let them be little
Let them be little
Billy Dean - Thank God I'm A Country Boy
Well life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well a simple kinda life never did me no harm
A raisin' me a family and workin' on a farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
When the work's all done and the sun's settlin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play ''sally goodin''' all day if I could
But the lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I could, work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds and jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
Iid rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy
Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine
A lotta sad people thinkin' that's mighty keen
Son, let me tell ya now exactly what I mean
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side
Said, ''live a good life and play my fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy
My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Taught me how to love and how to give just a little
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
Thank God I'm a country boy
Billy Gilman - Awaken the Music
There was always the voice of an angel
In the sweet lullaby of my dreams
Who would sing me a song made in Heaven
That awakened the music in me
You gave my life such meaning
Shined light upon my soul
And you were always there to hold
When I come to the end of tomorrows
And I look back on all of my days
I imagine I'll be there beside you
And we'll talk in our usual way
And we will dance
We will sing
Still amazed by everything
And we will dance and we will sing
We're still amazed by everything
The simple joys that life can bring
The songs you taught me how to sing and yes
We will sing them again
In my heart they'll never end
When I'm lost I pray that I can find you
When the darkness seems to hide the light
When I'm up I know I'm flying with you
All the things I love are all because of you
Because of you
You were always the one with the courage
Taught me all that I needed to know
When I needed a shoulder to cry on
You would reach out a hand I could hold
Your strength and all your kindness
Became a part of me
And I will always try to be
I'll be, the me, you hoped I'd always be
S O L O
We will dance
We will sing
Still amazed by everything
And we will dance and we will sing
We're still amazed by everything
The simple joys that life can bring
The songs you taught me how to sing and yes
We will sing them again
In my heart they'll never end
In your eyes, I always see my future
In your smile, I always see the reason for my ways
In your voice, I know the truth has meaning
When you sing to me I hear your heart speak to me
There was always the voice of an angel
In the sweet lullaby of my dreams
Who would sing me a song made in Heaven
That awakened the music in me
The music in me
Billy Gilman - Coming Home
When you change the way you look at things
The things you look at change
I can see the world so differently
Seeing things your way
There's a path that's right in front of me
That's been calling me for days
And I know that when you walk with me
It will be for always
You give me everything I have
Everything I need
You are the reason
Why I believe
:
All my love I want to give to you
All my life I want to see you
In my dreams you opened up my eyes
To a world that I have never seen
I'm coming home
When I see the way the early dawn
drives the night away To reveal a world that's holding on
To see a brighter day
I can only hope for everyone
To feel the way I do
Live their life to love someone
The way that I love you
You give me everything I have
Everything I need you are the reason why I believe
2nd 
All my love I want to give to you
All my life I want to see you
In my dreams you opened up a world That I have never seen
For always I will remain faithful
To the faith you have in me Can't believe how much I have grown
With you I'm finally Coming Home
Through you I see the fight that will take me home All the days of my life
For always I will remain faithful
To the faith you have in me Can't believe how much I have grown
With you I'm finally Coming Home
Billy Gilman - Everything and More
You never looked more beautiful
Than you look tonight
In your eyes I see all I can be
And how you changed my life
You held on when I let go
Now all I want is to let you know

Your love is like a river
It runs through my heart and soul
It's deep when I'm thristy and warm when I'm cold
And when I feel forgotten I come runnin' to your shore
And find peace of mind time after time
You give me everything and more
When tomorrow comes I will face the morning
In a different light
You can change your mind a thousand times
Nothing will ever change mine 'cause

The sun will rise and the light will shine
Everything will be alright
Oh, yes it will 'cause

Your love is like a river
It runs through my heart and soul
It's deep when I'm thristy and warm when I'm cold
And when I feel forgotten I come runnin' to your shore
And find peace of mind time after time
You give me everything and more
Billy Gilman - Hey, Little Suzie
(The Cause of All That)
I remember her
Shakin' off the dust
She could walk the walk, she was one of us
When she went away, I went down that day
Tried to cheer her, said you won't be missin' much
All that I remember when I think of her back then
Is a fast talkin', fun lovin' girl we called a friend

Hey, little Suzie just got back She still wearin' her baseball hat
But struck out twice and came back to sit with me The
game got called on account of the weather the rain came down we huddled together
Thinkn' that life couldn't get better and
When she walked away I noticed she was lookin' back
I hope that I'm the cause of all that
An accidental touch
Never meant so much
Makes me realize
That we're not close enough
She used to talk so loud
Now she's wispering
Tryin' to draw me in
And I'm listening
She was always after something
Now I wonder if it's me
Maybe I'm just dreamin' but I call'em as I see'em

Hey, little Suzie just got back She still wearin' her baseball hat
But struck out twice and came back to sit with me The
game got called on account of the weather the rain came down we huddled together
Thinkn' that life couldn't get better and
When she walked away I noticed she was lookin' back
I hope that I'm the cause of all that
Look what she shares
when she's playin' with her hair
Tells me where she's comin' from
And that it's goin' somewhere
Well hey, little Suzie just got back
She still wearin' her baseball hat
But struck out twice and came back to sit with me
The game got called on account of the weather
Rain came down
we huddled together
I swear no uniform ever looked better
And when she walked away I noticed she was lookin' back
I hope that I'm the cause of all that
Hey, little Suzie just got back
Billy Gilman - I'm Not Me Anymore
Is this my bed
What's goin' on in my head
I fell so different today
I have this image of you
My freedom, my courage, the strength I never knew
I found the answer through you
Discovered the glory of living through you
You taught me so much
Your words lift me up
I'm not me anymore
I'm all of us and a part of you
I'm not me anymore
I'm here for you
With every beat of my heart
I come closer to you
I have this vision of you
My kindness, my faith
I attribute to you
I share my secrects with you
You taught me forgivness with all that you do
To have someone you trust can change you so much
:
Closer than
I've ever been to knowing your love never ends
And even when my heart is aching
Knowing that you'll take me in
And love me again

Billy Gilman - Is Anybody Out There
When the thunder came
With our flag in flames
Everybody changed their color
When the night became
So dark with pain
Everyone became a brother
I came across the universe
And I don't know why
I came across the universe
To hear a soldier cry
Is anybody out there
Is anybody listening to my prayer
Is anybody there
If you can hear me please take me out of here
Is anybody out there
Is anybody out there
And the morning light
Makes you wonder why
You were ever born to see it
When your body's cold
It's not the story told
To the brave young suols who believe it
They came across the battlefield
And they son't know why
They came across the universe
To hear a soldier cry
Is anybody out there
Is anybody listening to my prayer
Is anybody out there
If you can hear me please take me out of here
Is anybody listening
Is anybody out there
All his friends know he fears the end
And he'll die for them if he had to
Rise again
Fall again
In the end God will come to the rescue
Is anybody out there
Is anybody listening to my prayer
Is anybody out there
If you can hear me please take me out of here
Is anybody listening
Is anybody out there
Billy Gilman - Looked into the Wings
I could feel you reaching out for me
Before we ever touched
And I knew you would always be
Someone I could trust
I felt your presence through the good times and the bad
You kept the faith
You always have

When you saw me getting nowhere
Trying to find a new direction
For a stubborn little voice that said I didn't have a prayer
When my star began to fade
And I found the stage was bare
I looked into the wings and you were there
I felt like I was falling
Going over the edge
And in this new altitude
I couldn't catch my breath
I turned my face to Heaven and it was then I realized
My guardian angel
Was here by my side

When you saw me getting nowhere
Trying to find a new direction
For a stubborn little voice that said I didn't have a prayer
When my star began to fade
And I found the stage was bare
I looked into the wings and you were there
Bridge:
This song belongs to you
And you know every word is true
God only knows were I would be without you, oh
Solo:
When my star began to fade
And I found the stage was bare
I looked into the wings
I looked into the wings, I looked into the wings
And you were there
And you were there
Billy Gilman - Missed You on Sunday
You're flyin' loose and I'm losin' ground with you
Want you to stay cause I can't follow you
You know I'll wait forever if you want me to
It's not you talkin', I know it's who you're talkin' to
:
Missed you on Sunday cause you weren't there
Saw you on Monday with purple hair
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday, our number one day
Yeah, I'm missing the answer to my prayers
I see you walkin' through the danger zone
That's not the way I used to walk you home
Don't wanna hold you back I'll let you go alone
And pray that someday you'll come back on your own
:
Missed you on Sunday cause you weren't there
Saw you on Monday with purple hair
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday, our number one day
Yeah, I'm missing the answer to my prayers
Some people say I'm such a fool to wait for you
But I can't close the gates to Heaven we once knew
Not such a mystery
Always been clear to me
When you're around I see
The sun come shinin' through
:
Missed you on Sunday cause you weren't there
Saw you on Monday with purple hair
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday, our number one day
Yeah, I'm missing the answer to my prayers
Billy Gilman - Peaceable Kingdom
The leopard with a harmless kid lay down
And not one savage beast was seen to frown
The wolf did with the lamb kin dwell in peace
His grim carnivorous nature there did cease
The lion with the fatling on did move
And a little child was leading them in love
Long ago there was a young painter
Who had a dream that every creature came
And stood assembled at his side
And he painted the sight that had sweetened his night
Fully one hundred times before he died
A kid and lion and a snake and a child
Wide-eyed and formal and smiln' like the sun had stopped
And time had ceased to move
And th ewolf andthe lamb came and ate from his hand
And a man-child was leading them in love

Oh, my friend, have you seen all the lines and the spaces
The colors that the young painter sees
In the peacealble kingdom that shines in the faces of people from more gentle times than these
I find myself adrift these days
An endless maze of ends and ways
And the world just seems so crazy to me here
But look away, back or forward from today
To the visions of either fools or seers
Such a beautiful place full of joy, full of grace
It was bathed in a saintly yellow light
Too unlearned to know that such things can't be so
He could only believe that they might

Oh, my friend, have you seen all the lines and the spaces
The colors that the young painter sees
In the peacealble kingdom that shines in the faces of people from more gentle times than these
Billy Gilman - Pray for Him
Knocked on his door last night
He shoulda' been there
I waited till 6pm
Lord, I'm worryin' again
Said he messed up something real bad
Whatever it is
I'll be there
:
I'll pray for him
Hope he's alright
Fells like he's all alone
Against the world tonight
He's gone away
Lord, help me pray for him
Told him he's got to believe
There's a lot to believe in
Doesn't think he good enough
Says it doesn't matter much
If I were walkin' in his shoes
He'd be there for me
He'd know what to do
:
I'll pray for him
Hope he's alright
Fells like he's all alone
Against the world tonight
He's gone away
Lord, help me pray for him
BRIDGE:
I've done everything I can do
I leave it in your hands
Lord, it's up to you
:
I'll pray for him
Hope he's alright
Fells like he's all alone
Against the world tonight
He's gone away
Lord, help me pray for him
Billy Gilman - Something 'Bout Heaven
When I'm walkin' by myself along the path that I should follow
I can see one reason why I'm happy I can face tomorrow
No one's gonna change my mind I'm gonna let my spirits climb
As high as I can go
I feel this way because I know
:
There's somethin' 'bout heaven
That brings you down to Earth
Here in the moment
With chapter and verse
It's all about livin' life for all it's worth
It's Heaven on Earth sharing my life with you
Suddenly I'm in a place I've never been and see no danger
All you said was walk with me and you will never be a stranger
All the world is here for me
I opened up my eyes to see it
that's the way I see it and it's all because of you
:
There's somethin' 'bout heaven
That brings you down to Earth
Here in the moment
With chapter and verse
It's all about livin' life for all it's worth
It's Heaven on Earth sharing my life with you
Oh, its Heaven on Earth
Sharing my life with you
I am free cause I can see so far beyond the here and now
Knowing Heaven waits for me just clears it up for me somehow
Everything I see
hear, with everything you touch it's clear
You are with me everywhere You never let me down
Cause there's somethin' 'bout Heaven
That brings you down to Earth
Here in the moment
With chapter and verse
It's all about livin' life for all it's worth
It's Heaven on Earth sharing my life with you
Billy Gilman - Three Words, Two Hearts, One Kiss
For a straight-A student who knows so much
You don't know nothin' 'bout love
You and me make history
There's no two hearts like us
Well go on pretend
You can't figure it out
Well if there's any doubt
:
Let me spell it out for you, honey
You don't want to miss
The perfect combination of
Three words, two hearts, one kiss
Three words, two hearts, one kiss
I know where I'm supposed to be
A heart beats right on time
I don't know why you're holdin' back
When you're the first in line
We better catch this train
Waitin' on the tracks
Cause it might not come back
Let me spell it out for you, honey
You don't want to miss
The perfect combination of
Three words, two hearts, one kiss, oh!
S O L O
Three words that say I love you
Two hearts that beat as one, oh
Let me spell it out for you, honey
You don't want to miss
The perfect combination of
Three words, two hearts, one kiss
The perfect combination of
Three words, two hearts, one kiss - ooh yeah
Blaine Larsen - How Do You Get That Lonely
It was just another story written on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score
It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
They found him face down on the bedroom floor
There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home
Then out on Mooresville highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone...

How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
Did his girlfriend break up with him, did he buy or steal that gun?
Did he lose a fight with drugs or alcohol?
Did his Mom and Daddy forget to say I love you son?
Did no one see the writing on the wall?
I'm not blamin' anybody, we all do the best we can
I know hindsight's 20/20, but I still don't understand...

How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
It was just another story printed on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score...
Blake Shelton - Some Beach
driving down the interstate
running thirty minutes late
singing margaritaville and minding my own
some foriegn car driving dude
with a road rage attitude
pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
he started yellin at me
like i did something wrong
he flipped me the bird
and then he was gone

some beach somewhere
there's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
palm trees are growing
warm breeze is blowing
i picture myself right there
on some beach somewhere
i circled the parking lot tryin to find a spot
just big enough i could park my old truck
a man with a big cigar was gettin into his car
i stopped an i waited for him to back up
from out of no where a mercedes benz
came cruisin up and whipped right in

some beach somewhere
there's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
palm trees are growing
warm breeze is blowing
i picture myself right there
on some beach somewhere
there's cold marguritas and hot senioritas waiting there
i sit in that waiting room it seemed like all afternoon
nurse finally said docs ready for you
but he stuck that needle down into my gum
and he started drillin before it was numb

some beach somewhere
there's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
palm trees are growing
warm breeze is blowing
i picture myself right there
on some beach somewhere
there's a beautiful sunset burnin up the atmosphere
there's music
on some beach
somewhere

Blue County - Nothin' But Cowboy Boots
It was Indiana, a summer day
and I was three years old
My momma said go out to play
well, I did what I was told
She never saw it comin'
when I turned the sprinkler on
She looked up from the dishes
and right there in the front lawn
Nothin' but cowboy boots
sets your spirit free
That wild wild western birthday suit
is the remedy for modesty
It ain't proper, it ain't cool
but folks remember what you do
in nothin', whoa nothin', but cowboy boots
Well all it takes, when you're eighteen
is your buddy's double dare
It was eight o'clock on a friday night
in the middle of Town Square
Couldn't hear the sirens
'cause so many people cheered
When the sheriff showed up,
I was grinnin' ear to ear
In nothin' but cowboy boots
sets your spirit free
That wild wild western birthday suit
is the remedy for modesty
It ain't proper, it ain't cool
but folks remember what you do
in nothin', whoa nothin', but cowboy boots
I came home late tonight
You just smiled at my surprise
I see ya comin' down the hall, whoa
in nothin', whoa
Nothin' but cowboy boots
sets your spirit free
That wild wild western birthday suit
is the remedy for modesty
It ain't proper, it ain't cool
but folks remember what you do
in nothin', whoa nothin',
no no nothin', but those cowboy boots
oh no no nothin', no
nothin' but those cowboy boots
Blue County - That Summer Song
At a red stop light in some sleepy town
An old truck pulled up with the windows down
That song from the past was playin' full blast
And all at once I was seventeen
And my car became a time machine
And all those years just disappeared
I could almost see my Janie beside me
Her bare feet up on the dash
And the boy I was
Was stirred up inside me
Tuggin' my heart
And takin' me back
Hey yeah yeah that summer song
We cranked it up and sang out strong
Every night we danced 'till dawn
And listened to it over and over
Hey yeah that summer song
We learned about love as we went along
Those glory days may be long gone
This feelin' still lives on
In that summer song
That summer song
On the night of the day I got my first car
I grabbed my brand new keys
And my old guitar
I picked up my girl
Man I owned the world
And the minute that we parked out on White Lake Road
There it was again
On my radio
Just in time
As her lips met mine
Oh well I can't help wonderin' where Janie is now
Is she still stealin' hearts like she used to do
Maybe she's somewhere listenin' somehow
Tuned in at this moment and feelin' it too
Hey yeah yeah that summer song
We cranked it up and sang out strong
Every night we danced 'till dawn
And listened to it over and over
Hey yeah that summer song
We learned about love as we went along
Those glory days may be long gone
This feelin' still lives on
In that summer song
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah
Hey yeah yeah that summer song
We cranked it up and sang out strong
Those glory days may be long gone
This feelin' still lives on
In that summer song
That summer song
That summer song
Blue County - That's Cool
Shootin' dr. Pepper cans with your brand new red ryder
That old folding lawn chair makes the perfect x-wing fighter
Those no-name baseball cards spinning in your spokes
Now that's cool
Turnin' 17 and daddy loosens up the curfew
Drivin' home at midnight that old buick smells like perfume
Making your own money, having coffee with your folks
Now that's cool

Knowin' where you're goin' embracin' where you've been
Being criticized for standin' strong in a battle you can't win
Livin' in a moment you may never see again
Let your heart break some rules
Now that's cool
Wakin' up with your new bride a room beside the ocean
10 years later goin' back to relive that emotion
She tells you what she's thinking but never says a word
Now that's cool

The pitcher is your six year old, you're his full time catcher
He gets a new bb gun and 'you'll put your eye out' lecture
Your 3 year old is singin' the song that she just learned
Now that's cool

Brad Cotter - I Meant To
Things get in the way
The rush of everyday
Ordinary stuff we all get into
Wouldn't it be sad, if all you ever had
was a granite epitaph that said 'I meant to'
CHORUS:
So any pretty woman I didn't take the time to kiss
Any crazy thing I didn't do, 'I meant to'
Any dirty liar I didn't stare right in the eye
and make him tell the naked truth, 'I meant to'
I'm always on the run some things get lost some get done
But if I didn't have all the fun I meant to, 'I meant to'
And if I never came out and said to each and everyone I love, how much I really do, 'I meant to'

Maybe this one chance
Is all we really have
Maybe all you got, is what you get to
Well I ain't gonna cry
I'll give it my best try
Then kiss the world goodbye and say 'I meant to'
REPEAT CHORUS
I meant to
I meant to
Brad Paisley - Alcohol
I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
with somebody twice
your size. . .
Well I've been known to cause a few breakups
and I've been known to cause a few births
I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work.

And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lyncheburg Bourbon, France
Been makin the bars
With lots of big money
and helpin white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
and college now that was a ball
you had some of the best times
you'll never remember with me
Alcohol, Alcohol
I got blamed at your wedding reception
for your best man's emberrasing speech
and also for those naked pictures of you at the beach
I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemingway write like he did
and I`ll bet you a drink or two that I can make you
put that lampshade on your head . .
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lyncheburg Bourbon, France
Been makin a fool out of folks
just like you

Brad Paisley - Celebrity
Someday I'm gonna be famous,
Do I have talent, well, no.
These days you don't really need it,
Thanks to reality shows
Can't Wait to date a supermodel,
Can't Wait to sue my dad.
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari
On my way to rehab....
Chorus-
Cause when you're a Celebrity
It's adios reality
You' can act just like a fool
People think you're cool
Just cause your on TV.
I can throw major fits
When my latte isn't just how I like it
They say I've gone insane,
I'll blame it on the fame,
And the pressures that it goes with
Being a Celebrity
uh huh
I get to cry to Barbara Walters,
When Things don't go my way.
I'll get community service
No matter which law I break
I'll make the supermarket tabloids,
They'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down,
THE MORE MY PRICE GOES UP!
Chorus-
Cause when you're a Celebrity,
It's adios reality.
No matter what you do,
People think you're cool,
Just cause you're on TV.
I can fall in and out of love,
Have marriages that barely last a month.
When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on fame
And say it's just so tough.
Being a Celebrity
So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
To the land of fun in the sun
We'll be real world bachelors
Jackass Millionaires
Hey, Hey, Hollywood
Here we come!
Chorus-
Yeah, When you're a Celebrity
It's adios reality
No matter what you do,
People think you're cool,
Just cause you're on t.v.
...Being a Celebrity
...Yeah Celebrity!
...uh-huh

Brad Paisley - I Wish You'd Stay
I talked to my sister in Memphis,
And told her you were movin' to town.
Here's her number,
She said she'd be glad to show you around.
Well, I left a map on your front seat,
Just in case you lose your way.
But don't worry,
Once you reach Sallisaw it's all interstate.
I know you need to go.
But before you do, I want you to know:
That I wish you the best.
And I wish you nothing less,
Than everything you've ever dreamed of.
And I hope that you find love along the way.
But most of all, I wish you'd stay.
I figure right about sundown,
You'll be in West Tennessee.
And by then,
Maybe, I'll understand, why you had to leave.
I know that you've done some changin',
And I know there's no changin' your mind.
Yes I know,
We've been through this a thousand times.
I'm sorry for still holdin' on;
I'll try to let go and I'll try to be strong.
And I wish you the best.
And I wish you nothing less,
Than everything you've ever dreamed of.
I hope that you find love along the way.
Most of all, I wish you'd stay.
Yes, everything you've ever dreamed of.
And I hope that you find love along the way.
But most of all, I wish you'd stay.
I wish you'd stay.

Brad Paisley - Little Moments
Well I'll never forget the first time that I heard
that pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I can't even remember now
what she backed my truck into
but she covered her mouth
and her face got red
and she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't
Even act like
I was mad
Yeah I live for
little moments
like that
That's like just last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector
in the house was going off
And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not
To let her see
me laugh
Yeah I live for
little moments
like that
I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank God that she isn't
cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections
It's the sudden change of plans
when she misreads the directions
and we're lost but holding hands
Yeah I live for little moments like that
When she's layin on my shoulder
on the sofa in the dark
and about the time she falls asleep
so does my right arm
and I want so bad to move it cause it's tingling and it's numb
she looks so much like an angel
that I don't wanna wake her up
yeah I live for little moments
when she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it
Yeah I live for little moments like that
Brad Paisley - Mud On The Tires
I've got some big news, the bank fin'lly came through,
An' I'm holdin' the keys to my brand new Chevrolet.
Have you been outside? It sure is a nice night.
How about a little test drive down by the lake?
There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out.
We can try out the four-wheel drive.
C'mon now, whaddya say?
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night to be out there soakin' up the moonlight.
Stake out a little piece of shoreline.
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of no-where.
Only one way to get there.
You gotta get a little mud on the tires.
Moonlight on a duck blind, catfish on a trout line;
Sun sets about nine at this time of year.
We can throw a blanket down, crickets singin' in the background,
An' more stars than you can count on a night this clear.
I tell you, what we need to do is grab a sleepin' bag or two,
An' build us a little camp fire.
An' then with a little luck, we might just get stuck.
Let's get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night to be out there soakin' up the moonlight.
Stake out a little piece of shoreline.
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of no-where.
Only one way to get there.
You gotta get a little mud on the tires.
An' then with a little luck, we might just get stuck.
Let's get a little mud on the tires.

Brad Paisley - When I Get Where I'm Going
(Feat. Dolly Parton)
When I get where I'm going
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly
I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain

Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here
I'm gonna walk with my grand daddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck

Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here
So much pain and so much darkness
In this world we stumble through
All these questions I can't answer
So much work to do
But when I get where I'm going
And I see my maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of his amazing grace
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
Hallelujah
I will love and have no fear
When I get where I'm going
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Brad Paisley - Whiskey Lullaby
She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her till I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
(Sing lullaby)
The rumors flew but nobody know how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night

She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away is memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
Brian McComas - The Middle Of Nowhere
Lately baby we've been lettin' pride get in the way
Sayin' things that we don't mean, meanin' what we don't say
Things have been so crazy that we lost our peace of mind
But I think I know the perfect place to leave it all behind
Chorus:
They got sunshine every mornin'
They got moonshine every night
They got sweet love flowin' like a river off the mountainside
We're gonna kiss a little, fish a little
Baby, we won't have a care
Plant our feet in the soft green grass
Smack dab, way out, back in the middle of nowhere
I said, the middle of nowhere
Life can get away sometimes before you know it's gone
That solid ground can turn out to be sand you're standin' on
We need a little time to find the fire we once knew
Girl, and paradise is waitin' right down Highway 62
Repeat Chorus
Just you and me, the sky, the lakes and trees
The middle of nowhere
No baby, we won't want to leave - no
That sunshine every mornin'
That moonshine every night
That sweet love flowin' like a river off the mountainside
Yeah, we're gonna kiss a little, fish a little
Baby, we won't have no cares
Plant our feet in the soft green grass
Smack dab, way out, back in
That sunshine every mornin'
That moonshine every night
That sweet love flowin' like a river off the mountainside
We're gonna kiss a little, fish a little
Baby, we won't have a care
Plant our feet in the soft green grass
Smack dab, way out, back in the middle of no, no, no, nowhere
Baby, get in the car
You know it ain't far
To the middle of nowhere

Dunn - Believe
Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where i grew up
Momma used to send me over with things
We struck a freindship up
I spent a few long summers out on his old porch swing
Says he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
How ya keep from going crazy
He said I'll see my wife and son in just a little while
I asked him what he meant
He looked at me and smiled, said

I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what i can see
Oh i believe
Few years later i was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Getting all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said oh by the way son, old man Wrigley's died.
Later on that night, i laid there thinkin' back
Thought 'bout a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody desevred a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man who looked me in the eye, said

I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what i can see
I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that i live
Yeah, this can't be
No, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is

When I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what i can see
I believe
Oh, I
I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe

Dunn - It's Getting Better All The Time
I don't stop breathing every time the phone rings
My heart don't race when someones at my door
I've almost given up thinkin' your ever gonna call
I don't believe in magic anymore.
I just don't lie awake at night
Asking God would get you off my mind
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time.
Yeah, I got to work on time again this morning
This old job is all that I got to live
And no one even noticed I'd been crying
At least I don't have whisky on my breath.
Yeah, I think I'm gonna make it
'Cause God won't make a mountain I can't climb
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time.
God, I hope your happy
Girl, I wish you well
I just might get over you
You can never tell.
I always thought that I'd do something crazy
If ever saw you out with someone else
But when the moment came last night
I couldn't say a word, I stood there in the dark all by myself.
Yeah, I could of said a million things
All I did was keep it locked inside
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time.
It's getting better all the time

Yes, she blew through the door like TNT,
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me.
Said:
I'm a whiskey drinkin', cowboy chasin', helluva time.
I like Kenny, Keith, Allan and Patsy Cline.
I'm a full grown Queen Bee lookin' for honey.
Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country.
Yeah, the band took a break,
The DJ played P Diddy.
She said:

Somethin' thumpin' from the city.

Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.

Well you work and you slave
And you spend all day in your thankless job
hen you jump in your Ford
And you're door to door with the homebound mob
Then you pull in the drive and you hit the chair
And the one that you love is waiting there
And, hey --
That's what it's all about
Hey, this is the life I couldn't live without
It's a moment frozen there in time
Where the reasons all begin to rhyme
Where love's a little bigger And you finally start figuring out
That's what it's all about
Well, they won't go to bed
Or do what you said or eat their food
They cry and they fuzz and you can't
even cuss 'cause they'll say it, too
You're tired and you're numb
And you're stressed and you're mad
And she smiles and says 'I love you, Dad'
And, hey --
That's what it's all about
Hey, this is the life I couldn't live without It's a moment frozen there in time Where the reasons all begin to rhyme
Where love's a little bigger And you finally start figuring out

She said what she wants is a man to be faithful
A true heart somebody willin? and able
To stay by her side through thick and thin
A tender touch every now and then
She?s not hung up on fairy tales
Or some dream at the bottom of a wishin? well
Fancy cars or diamond rings
What she wants most are the little things
That?s what she gets
That?s what she gets
That?s what she gets for loving me
At times I lay awake at night
Stare at her laying by my side
Knowin? there in her heart as she sleeps
She can forever count on me
That?s what she gets
That?s what she gets
That?s what she gets for loving me
Whatever turns her on
I?m here to do it
Till the day they write my name in stone
I?ll live to prove it

Connie came back from her second cousin's wedding
First time she'd been home in 'bout a year or two
Just in time for the rehearsal dinner
But that crazy Connie wasn't wearing any shoes

She lives in L.A. she flies to New York City
That woman's been around the world
You can take that girl out of the honky tonk
But you can't take the honky tonk, can't take the honky tonk
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well the dinner broke up at about 11:30
And the boys went off to do what boys will do
Connie said come here girls we need to huddle up
Around something that's a hundred proof
[Repeat Chorus]
It's nine a.m. in front of the church
People are going nuts just looking for the groom
And by the way where's Connie
She's run off with that boy in Cancun

Buddy Jewell - Help Pour Out The Rain
The moment was custom-made to order:
I was ridin' with my daughter on our way back from Monroe.
An' like children do, she started playin' twenty questions,
But I never could've guessed one would touch me to my soul.
She said:
Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste 
                      the Milky Way?
Are we goin' there to visit, or are we goin' there 
                      to stay?
Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings?
An' do you think that God could use another Angel,
To help pour out the rain?
Well, I won't lie: I pulled that car right over,
An' I sat there on the shoulder tryin' to dry my misty eyes.
An' I whispered:
Lord, I wanna thank you for my children.
'Cause your innocence that fills them often takes 
                      me by surprise.
Like:
Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste the 
                      Milky Way?
Are we goin' there to visit, or are we goin' there 
                      to stay?
Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings?
An' do you think that God could use another Angel,
To help pour out the rain?
Well, I thought about it later on,
An' a smile came to my face.
An' when I tucked her in to bed,
I got down on my knees an' prayed.
Lord, when I get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?
I don't wanna come to visit 'cause I'm comin' home 
                      to stay?
An' I can't wait to see my family and meet Jesus face 
                      to face.
An' do you think, Lord, you could use just one more 
                      Angel,
To help pour out the rain?
Mmmm, can I help pour out the rain?
Buddy Jewell - If She Were Any Other Woman
If she were any other woman

But Ive found shes where I find it

If she was any other woman
She wouldnt have this hold on me

Buddy Jewell - Sweet Southern Comfort
A misty sunrise in my hometown,
Rows of cotton 'bout knee high.
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road,
Still got clothes out on the line.
Irwin Nichols, there with Judsley,
Playin' Chequers at the gin.
When I dream about the Southland,
This is where it all begins.
From Carolina down to Georgia,
Smell the Jasmine and Magnolia.
Sleepy sweet home, Alabama,
Roll Tide Roll.
Muddy water, Mississippi,
Blessed Graceland whispers to me.
Carry on, carry on:
Sweet southern comfort, carry on.
Catchin' catfish on the river;
Chasin' fireflies by the creek.
Kissin' Gary Williams' sister,
On the porch, homecoming week.
With rusted cars and weepin' willows,
Keepin' watch out in the yard.
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie,
Could be anywhere you are,
In Carolina or in Georgia,
Open arms are waitin' for you.
Louisiana, Yellow Rose of,
San Antone.
Arkansas, Mississippi,
Old man river whispers to me:
Carry on, carry on:
Sweet southern comfort, carry on.
Instrumental break.
As I sit here I'm surrounded,
By these priceless memories.
I don't have to think about it:
Theres no place I'd rather be.
Than Carolina or in Georgia,
Smell the Jasmine and Magnolia.
Sleepy sweet home, Alabama,
Roll Tide Roll.
Muddy water, Mississippi,
Blessed Graceland whispers to me.
Carry on, carry on:
Sweet southern comfort,
Carry on, carry on:
Sweet southern comfort, carry on.
Carolyn Dawn Johnson - Die Of A Broken Heart
I keep having these disturbing dreams:
My final days, the end of me.
For some odd reason, I get one last wish,
And every time, I wish for this:
Take me fast or take me slow.
I don't really care how I go.
In the daylight or in the dark,
Just don't let me die of a broken heart.
The kind of pain that you just can't take,
Will send a strong man to his grave.
There's not a pill that can give you a rest,
Or fill that hole deep in your chest.
So, take me fast or take me slow.
I don't really care how I go.
In the daylight or in the dark,
Just don't let me die of a broken heart.
No.
Instrumental break.
(Yeah, yeah.
(Yeah, Yeah.)
I've been crushed by that hurt before.
There's no way I could take any more.
If I fell in love, and I found out it would happen again,
I'd say take me now.
And take me fast or take me slow.
I don't really care how I go.
In the daylight or in the dark,
Just don't let me die of a broken heart.
Take me fast or take me slow.
I don't really care how I go.
In the daylight or in the dark,
Just don't let me die of a broken heart.
No, don't let me die of a broken heart.
No.
Carolyn Dawn Johnson - Simple Life
I have wondered this world far and wide
I've been all around to the other side
But there's nothin' like comin' home
I wanna sit on my front porch and drink my lemonade
Cut my grass after church every Sunday
And go out on Saturday night
Live the simple life
Wake up in the morning to these fields of gold
And take a long walk down a gravel road
Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that I'll always have someone to hold
Oh I-I-I wanna live the simple life
I wanna take a blanket down to the creek
And let the water sing me to sleep
Let go of time
Live the simple life
Lately I've seen too many city lights
I wanna go somewhere where I can see the stars at night
Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that I'll always have someone to hold
Oh I-I-I wanna live the simple life
Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that I'll always have someone to hold
Oh I-I-I wanna live the simple life
Carrie Underwood - Jesus, Take The Wheel
She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It would been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was sooo scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this all on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this all my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, why, oh
Casey James - Crying On A Suitcase
Boy don't wait, don't think, don't lock the door behind you
Run and jump into your truck, hit the gas, burn some rubber up
Yeah your time's running out
Do it now
Take a shortcut, take a back road, take the shoulder to the exit
Skip the parking, screw the ticket, hit the curb and leave it sitting
Whatever it takes
You gotta get to that gate
She's cryin' on a suitcase
Sittin' at the airport
Waitin' on an airplane
Bound to take her out of here
Ooh
They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky
You better run while you still got time
She's cryin' on a suitcase
Admit it boy you blew it, you really messed it up
You can make excuses if you really want to lose her
It's all on the line, do or die time
Getting on your knees time
Tell her that you want her, need her, love her, gotta have her
Everything good in your life begins and ends with her
Lose your pride while you can
Come on man be a man
She's cryin' on a suitcase
Sittin' at the airport
Waitin' on an airplane
Bound to take her out of here
Ooh
They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky
You better run while you still got time
She's cryin' on a suitcase
She's cryin' on a suitcase
Waitin' on an airplane
Bound to take her out of here
They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky
You better run while you still got time
Well you still got time
She's cryin' on a suitcase
Waitin' on an airplane
She'll fade into a goodbye sky
Catherine Britt - The Upside Of Being Down
I don't have to put on make up,
I don't have to do my hair.
An'd when I open up that Hagen Daz,
Well, I don't have to share.
An' there's no one there to notice,
If I gain a couple a-pounds:
An' that's the upside of bein' down.
Well, I've got twice the closet space,
That I can fill up with new shoes.
And I can paint the bedroom pretty pink,
With lacy curtains if I choose.
An' I won't have to deal with fishin' gear,
Muddy boots laying round:
That's the upside of being down.
Days when I'm feelin' low, yeah, I got 'em:
When my tears won't stop fallin' to the ground.
But there's only one place left to go when you're at the bottom,
An' that's the upside of being down.
I can let my dog jump on the bed,
An' curl up next to me at night.
An' I don't have to lose an argument,
'Cause now I'm always right.
An' I can dance with who I want to,
When I go out on the town:
An' that's the upside of being down.
Days when I'm feelin' low, yeah, I got 'em:
When my tears won't stop fallin' to the ground.
But there's only one place left to go when you're at the bottom,
An' that's the upside of being down.
Yeah, that's the upside of being down.
Chely Wright - Back Of The Bottom Drawer
In the back of the bottom drawer
Of the dresser by our bed
Is a box of odds and ends that I have always kept
But the man who sleeps beside me
Doesn't know it's even there
Little pieces of my past
That I shouldn't have to share
A napkin that is stained with time
Has a poem on it that didn't quite rhyme, but it made me cry
In a 'Dear Jane' letter from a different guy
He broke up with me and he told me I'm not always right
And a stolen key from an old hotel room door
In the back of the bottom drawer
I don't keep these things 'cause I'm longing to go back
I keep them because I want to stay right where I'm at
I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs
I don't want to mess this up
But I wouldn't know where I belong
Without this box of stuff
A birthday card from my first boyfriend
He signed it 'I love you' so I gave in
Yeah, we went too far in his daddy's car
And those Mardi Gras beads from '98
We danced all night, stayed out so late
We thought we were stars, closing down the bars
That champagne was cheap but still I've got that cork
In the back of the bottom drawer
I'm not trying to hide these things from the man I love today
But I'm a better woman for him, thanks to my yesterdays
So now I try to give more than I take
And I bite my tongue, fight the urge to say it's my way
Or no way at all
And now I cherish love a whole lot more
'Cause of what's
In the back of the bottom drawer
Chely Wright - Bumper Of My S.U.V.
I've got a bright red sticker on the back of my car
Says United States Marines
And yesterday a lady in a mini-van held up a middle finger at me
Does she think she knows what I stand for
Or the things that I believe
Just by looking at a sticker for the US Marines
On The Bumper Of My SUV
See, my brother Chris, he's been in for more than 14 years now
Our dad was in the Navy during Vietnam
Did his duty then he got out
And my grandpa earned his purple heart
On the beach of Normandy
That's why I've got a sticker for the US Marines
On The Bumper Of SUV
But that doesn't mean that I want war
I'm not Republican or Democrat
But I've gone all around this crazy world
Just to try and better understand
Yes I do have questions
I get to ask them because I'm free
That's why I've got a sticker for the US Marines
On the Bumper Of My SUV
Cause I've been to Hiroshima
And I've been to the DMZ
I've walked on the sand in Baghdad
Still don't have all of the answers I need
But I guess I wanna know where she's been
Before she judges and gestures to me
Cause she don't like my sticker
For the US Marines
On the bumper of my SUV
So I hope that lady in her mini-van
Turns on her radio and hears this from me
As she picks up her kids from their private school
And drives home safely on our city streets
Or to the building where her church group meets
Yeah, that's why I've got a sticker for the US Marines
On the bumper of my SUV
Chely Wright - Everything
I heard a real good joke
That you would love
And if I'd heard it a few weeks before
I would have reached for the phone
And called you up
But we don't do that anymore
I guess we're just old friends
Who meet like this
In line at the grocery store
When we say goodbye, there is no kiss
'Cause we don't do that anymore
What do I wish I could undo
What do I want to say to you
What did I lose when I gave you back your ring
What did I change by letting go
What do I think I miss the most
Everything
When I'm flying high
Or slip and fall
Hey, that's what a best friend is for
There was a time we shared it all
But we don't do that anymore
What do I wish I could undo
What do I want to say to you
What did I lose when I gave you back your ring
What did I change by letting go
What do I think I miss the most
Everything
The way we laugh, the way we kiss
It just feels wrong to be like this
What do I wish I could undo
What do I want to say to you
What did I lose when I gave you back your ring
What did I change by letting go
What do I think I miss the most
Everything
Chely Wright - If I Were Jackie
If I had married JFK
I would have lost my mind
'Cause everybody seemed to know
How he pent his leisure time
Well I guess that things were different then
A wife just turned her head
But do you think she cried
When the President didn't make it home to bed
How did she survive
That kind of life
If I were Jackie
I'd got in one of those black sudans
And left the secret service in the dust
If I were Jackie
I'd of told Marylin you can keep that man
'Cause he's gonna cheat on you like he cheated on us.
She kept on facing forward and she held her head up high
Even when she smelled a strange perfume
She stood there by his side
She'd smile and she would wave
Like she had grown accustomed to
The picture of perfection like a debutante would do
Did she ever ask him
Where the hell have you been?
If I were Jackie
I'd got in one of those black sudans
And left the secret service in the dust
If I were Jackie
I'd of told Marylin you can keep that man
'Cause he's gonna cheat on you like he cheated on us.
(spoken)
Well i guess its easy to sit here today and say what I would do
Yeah, but we'll probably never know
If it was her weakness or or strength
That covered up the truth
If I were Jackie
I'd got in one of those black sudans
And left the secret service in the dust
If I were Jackie
I'd of told Marylin you can keep that man
'Cause he's gonna cheat on you like he cheated on us.
If I were Jackie
I'd got in one of those black sudans
And left the secret service in the dust
Chely Wright - It's The Song
Different day, different town
Set it up to tear it down
Oh I ain't been home in almost fifty days
Houston Baton Rouge
Poor girl's gotta pay her dues
And the speeder bus is always driving away
Oh I love what I do
But I wonder what I do it all for
But when I sing, they sing along
I forget where I am
But I know where I belong
The reason why I'm standing here
It's not the miles
It's not the pay
It's not the show
It's not the fame that makes this home
It's the song
Her birthday was in Alabama
Father's day was in Montana
And on Mother's day I was nowhere near the phone
Every hotel bed feels the same
As the last one where I stayed
And it's bending in my sheet
And falling asleep alone
Oh I love what I do
But I wonder what I do it all for
When I sing, they sing along
I forget where I am
But I know where I belong
The reason why I'm standing here
It's not the miles
It's not the pay
It's not the show
It's not the fame that makes this home
It's the song
Dolly and Loretta
Maybe some Patsy Cline
I'm so lonesome I could cry
But when I sing, they sing along
I forget where I am
But I know where I belong
The reason why I'm standing here
It's not the ride
It's not the name
It's not just staying in the game
It's not the miles
It's not the pay
It's not the show
It's not the fame that makes this home
It's the song
It's the song
Chely Wright - Love Lets Go
I can't count the times we've sat and cried
Up all night, trying to work it out
But this feels different then it ever was
This is serious
Are we over now
Everything I've ever learned about love
Baby, I've learned it from us
Love can make you really believe
Love can knock you straight to your knees
Love can make you fight for the things you wanna hold
But sometimes, baby, love lets go
You're the only one who ever thought
That I was strong, and liked it.
And I'm the only one you'd ever tell
When you needed help, like I did
I know it hurts you to do this to me
But Baby, don't stay where you don't want to be.
Love can make you really believe
Love can knock you straight to your knees
Love can make you fight for the things you wanna hold
But sometimes, baby, love lets go
Sometimes, baby, love lets go
Chely Wright - Sex, Drugs and Rock
&
Roll
I never really partied a lot
Steamed up a few windows,
Kissing in cars
And that's as dangerous as I got
Didn't drink, didn't smoke
Did I think I could go through this world
Pure as an angel
A girl guarded from danger
It wasn't a lucky strike
Or a different lover everynight
Or a heavy metal song that made the warnings come true
There's no whiskey hard enough to do the damage that you've done
By packing up and leaving like you said you'd never do
It wasn't sex, drugs, and rock and roll that got me
It was you, it was you, it was you.
I should have been living it up
But I was little miss perfect and still ended up here
Well, I would have had a whole lot more fun
Than this mess that you see
Well I guess it would be my own bed
That I'd have to lie in
But instead, you left me crying
It wasn't a lucky strike
Or a different lover everynight
Or a heavy metal song that made the warnings come true
There's no whiskey hard enough to do the damage that you've done
By packing up and leaving like you said you'd never do
It wasn't sex, drugs, and rock and roll that got me
It was you, it was you, it was you.
There's no whiskey hard enough to do the damage that you've done
By packing up and leaving like you said you'd never do
It wasn't sex, drugs, and rock and roll that killed me
It was you, it was you, it was you
It was you, it was you, it was you.
Chris Cagle - Chicks Dig It
Hey y'all watch this!
Daddy's belt, mamas drapes
Standin' tall on the backyard shed
Lookin' cool in my superman cape
I told the neighbourhood girls
Said hey y'all, watch this
My fate was a broken arm
And my reward a one day kiss
When daddy asked me why I did it
I made him laugh out loud when I told him
Cause the chicks dig it
Scars heal... glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made, oh yeah
Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
Cause the chicks dig it
Oh yeah
Mmmm
Black top road, learner permit
Thought I was Earnhardt
Drivin' fast, but I didn't see the ditch
Took out a mailbox, then a fence, then a barn
The police came and called my father
But I met the farmer's daughter
And when the judge asked me why I did it
He threw the book at me when I told him
Cause the chicks dig it
Scars heal... glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made, oh yeah
Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Life is short so go on and live it
Cause the chicks dig it
Oh yeah
Ohh, oh
Just throw caution to the wind my friend
And then sit back and watch your life begin, cause
Scars heal... glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made
Yeah pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah, life's short so go on and live it
Cause the chicks dig it
Scars heal... glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made
Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
It don't matter if you lose or ifyou win it
Hey the chicks dig it
Oh yeah
Chicks dig it
Mmm
The chicks dig it
Ah, hey, aw yeah
The chicks dig it
I got this scar when I was three years old showing off for the girl next door
on my tricycle
And the on over my eye, well I got that back in '82 jumpin' off the train
tressele bridge
But I got the girl, hah, oh
The chicks dig it!
Chris Cagle - I'd Be Lying
()
If I told you that I was wrong
and wanted you to come back home,
I'd be lying.
And if I said that we could work it out
and you shouldn't have any doubts,
I'd be lying.
And if I got down on my knees
in front of God above
and swore before the angels
I'd give you my love.

I'd be lying next to you tonight
holding on with my whole life.
Right back where I belong.
Looking deep into your eyes
Man enough to realize
that honey, I was wrong.
If I could swallow my pride
and put myself in your shoes
and tell you that I understand
why you feel the way you do
then baby, I'd be lying...
I'd be lying next to you.
()
And if I told you that I loved you
and I put no one else above you,
I'd be lying.
And if I said you're the one for me
and I never set you free,
I'd be lying.
And if I somehow found the strength
to knock on your front door
and tell you face to face
I won't hurt you anymore.

I'd be lying next to you tonight.
Holding on with my whole life.
Right back where I belong.
Looking deep into your eyes
Man enough to realize
that honey, I was wrong.
If I could swallow my pride
and put myself in your shoes
and tell you that I understand
why you feel the way you do.
Then baby, I'd be lying...
I'd be lying next to you.
If I could swallow my pride
and put myself in your shoes
and tell you that I understand
why you feel the way you do.
Then baby, I'd be lying...
I'd be lying next to you.
Next to you...
If I told you I was wrong...
If I said that we could work it out...
If I got down on my knees...
Oh baby, I'd be lying...
Chris Cagle - Miss Me Baby
Miss me baby
When you hear our favourite song,
Miss me baby
And when you start to sing along
Think about all the times that we danced
In moonlight to it all night long, oh
Then miss me baby.
And want me honey,
Like you did the night you told me that you loved me
We couldn't wait anymore.
Left the keys in the door, took my hand
Pulled me down on the kitchen floor.
Yeah, we were that crazy
Then miss me baby.
Chorus:
Because when he's holding you,
Know that it's killing me,
Let my memory be the reason girl
That you can't sleep
And everytime you feel his touch,
I pray to God it's not enough
And that I've touched your heart so deep
Girl, you can't shake me
Cause I love you,
Yes I need you,
Miss me baby.
Miss me baby,
Until you can't take it no more
Miss me baby
Pack your bags and hit the door
I'm a man, I was wrong, forgive me
Come back home
I'll be waiting
Right here waiting
Miss me baby.
Chorus:
Because when he's holding you,
Know that it's killing me,
Let my memory be the reason girl
That you can't sleep
And everytime you feel his touch,
I pray to God it's not enough
And that I've touched your heart so deep
Girl, you can't shake me
Cause I love you,
Yes I need you,
Miss me baby.
Everytime you hear this song,
Miss me baby...
Chris Cagle - What a Beautiful Day
Day One
I stumbled through hello on 5th avenue
Day Two
We grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
Caught a movie on day Fourteen
And day sixty-seven she said I love you to me
Chorus:
Oh what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing....
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave but chose to stay
What a beautiful day 
Day One Sixteen
I asked her what she was doing for the rest of my life
Day One Eighty Nine
Oh I almost lost that girl to my Foolish pride
But she said I do on day Four Eighty Two
and gave me a son on day Seven Sixty One
Chorus
What a beautiful Day
Day Eighteen Thousand Two hundred and Fifty Three
Well honey thats fifty years
Yeah heres to you and me
Chorus
What a beautiful day 
Day one I thank god i said hello on 5th avenue
Clay Walker - A Few Questions
How in this world can we put a man on the moon,
And still have a need for a place like St Jude's?
And why is one man born,
In a place where all they know is war?
An' a guy like me,
Has always been free.
An' how can two people who built a lovin' home,
Try for years an' never have a child of their own?
When somewhere out there tonight,
There's a baby no-one's holdin' tight:
In need of love.
To me, that don't add up.
But I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans.
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky.
So I don't mean to second guess you,
Or criticise what I don't understand.
These are just a few questions I have.
An' why did my cousin have to die in that crash?
A good kid, only seventeen, I still wonder 'bout that.
It seems unfair to me,
Some get the chance to chase their dreams,
An' some don't.
But what do I know?
I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans.
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky.
So I don't mean to second guess you,
Or criticise what I don't understand.
These are just a few questions I have.
Why do I feel like you hear these prayers of mine.
When so many oughta be ahead of me in line?
When you look down on me,
Can you see the good through all the bad?
These just a few questions I have.
Clay Walker - I Can't Sleep
I've been up all night long
Just waitin' on the sun
I've given up damn the dawn
It ain't never gonna come
Something's wrong, as long as you're gone
Chorus:
I'm not gonna sleep til I touch your face
Baby not a wink I could go for days
If you ever needed to see me down on my knees
Take a look at me, baby I can't sleep
Remember when you said you wouldn't last
I couldn't swallow my pride
Whoa it's sinkin' in, baby losin' you has
Finally opened my eyes
I'm wide awake, as long as it takes
CHORUS
Cledus T. Judd - I Love NASCAR
We got owners, favorite drivers,
Boy, that Tony Stewart's a whiner.
An' we got rookies, advertisers,
**Like, let's say: Havoline, Target, xxxxx, Caterpiller, Exdale,
**Mountain Dew, Dupont Lows, Homebake, Poco, Kodak,
**M
Ms, UBF, Tired Old Tail, Gillette, Kelloggs, xxxxxx, Budweiser.
But the trophy girls still have my favorite parts.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
We got cautions, we got pitstops,
You can't hear a dang thing once the flag drops.
An' poor Cow Patty, an' swervin' Marlin, ha ha,
Are gonna find it tough to beat Mark Martin.
'Cause that Viagra car is always driven hard.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
I love NASCAR, it's my kind of race.
Just watchin' Jeff Gordon fly up a wall,
Puts a smile on Dale junior's face.
No caviar. It's it's beer an Mohawks.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
I like short tracks, you'll see more wrecks,
An' about a million screamin' rednecks.
An' ol' Jeff Burton, ha, an' poor Mike Skinner,
Well, they've done forgot what it's like to be a winner.
An' Ken Schrader still ain't sure who his sponsors are.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
**
Hey, that was a close one up there fellas.
**
But I got into one end.
**
I might pull over right up here next pitstop,
I want you to get two front tires.
I need a wedge on the left side to keep this windshield playin' on the gas.
An' you don't care, hand me a pair of underwear, I have messed all in my drawers.
I like football. (I like football.)
I like my wrestlin'.
I like a good game of air hockey,
I like some pinball now an' then.
How about you, Toby?
I love NASCAR, it's my kind of race.
Just to see Big E back on the track,
Would put a smile on every face.
No-one drove a car quite like Earnhardt.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
Vroom, vroom, vroom: Gentlemen, start your engines:
I love NASCAR.
Clint Black - Spend My Time
How can we know how far
The long way can be
Looking from where we are
It never seemed that long to me
I've many miles behind me
Maybe not so much ahead
Seems I made good time
With the directions I misread
I'm gonna spend my time
Like it's going out of style
I'm moving the bottom line
Farther than a country mile
I still have hills to climb
Before I hit that wall
No matter how much time I buy
I can never spend it all
Funny thing that time
We're always running out
I'm always losing mine
There's not enough of it about
And though it's always here
It will always come and go
The days become the years
That'll be gone before you know
So I'm gonna spend my time
Like it's going out of style
I'm moving the bottom line
Better than a country mile
I still have hills to climb
Before I hit that wall
I won't go quietly into that dark night
There'll be no more burning daylight
I'll be living in
Every moment that I'm in
I'm gonna spend my time
Like it's going out of style
I'll only use what's mine
I've been saving for a while
I still have hills to climb
Before I hit that wall
No matter how much time I buy
I can never spend it all
No matter how much time we buy
We can never spend it all
Clint Black - The Boogie Man
Next to Lousiana on the Texas side,
There's a little country joint where they let it ride.
There's a boogie woogie man on the piano,
An' all the backwoods boppers shoutin':
Go cat, go.
They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
So don't you,
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man.
Grandpa's in the corner in his fishing clothes,
Reelin' to the rhythm everywhere it goes.
All the boogie woogie babies tearing up the floor.
When they get a little bit, they want a little more.
They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
So don't you,
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man.
Instrumental break.
In a red El Dorado, at the break of day,
That Boogie Woogie man'll be slipping away.
Although you're never gonna know it when he's out of sight,
He'll shut a juke box down again tomorrow night.
He's never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
It works for me, it'll work for you,
He'll have you doin' things that you didn't know you knew.
So don't you,
Don't you be afraid.
No, don't ya,
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man, no.

You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train train uh hu hu uh hu hu yea,

Big black train coming round the bend,
Go kid go tell you mom and them,
Chugg a lugga ,
Who? The big black train commin' through to you boy you bell and bumped you head uh hu,
That's what they said,
People say it's impossible, not probable, too radical,
But I already been on the CMA's,
Hell Tim McGraw said he liked the change,
That he likes the way my Hick-hop sounds and the way the crowd screams when I stomp the ground,
Now, big and black, clickty clack and I make the train jump the track like that,
[Chorus - Big
Rich]
I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train train, uh hu hu uh hu hu,
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train train uh hu hu uh hu hu yea,
From Miketickasin deep into your ear,
My voice I your choice that you wanted to hear,
So the boys make the noise when the buffalo roams,
Blast into me bones that you might have known.
She be riding into town like a desperado,
With a big belt buckle,
The Cowboy Dorado,
All over the World Wide Web you'll see that low CDP on that MP3,
Speak clearly what I say so you comprehend in the name of Hick-hop radio tuned in,
Roaming like thunder on the scene,
It's kinda hard to describe if you know what I mean.
I never claimed to be the hardest of the hard rock brothers,
But I'm booming at the box,
Skills got you jumping out your socks.
From Texas here I come movin' your body with the base kick drum.
[Chorus - Big
Rich]
I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train train, uh hu hu uh hu hu,
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train train uh hu hu uh hu hu yea,
[Chorus - Cowboy Troy]
I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train train, uh hu hu uh hu hu,
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train train uh hu hu uh hu hu yea,
[Chorus - Big
Rich]
I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train train, uh hu hu uh hu hu,
You know that I play chicken with the train play chicken with the train train uh hu hu uh hu hu yea,
Huh, yea one time,
Get you some of that!
Craig Morgan - Look At Us
Found an old box in the bottom of the closet,
'Neath the bowlin' ball bag full of magazines.
An' a school sweater with a ring in the pocket,
From a first cigar; man, did I turn green?
Hey, honey, come look at what I just found.
This old picture of us when the carnival came to town.
An' I was Superman, Tarzan:
Thought I was a star in a rock an' roll band.
An' you were Lois Lane, Letty Jane.
I wasn't very good, but you were the biggest fan,
Of the man that your Momma warned you not to trust:
Now, baby, look at us.
There's a bracelet that I made you at our homecomin' party:
Bought a six-pack of Bud just to get the tabs.
Took you home, an' you wore it proudly,
But I got in trouble when you showed your Dad.
Here's a sticker from the Dixon drive-in show.
What movie was playin', we never did know.
I was Superman, Tarzan:
Thought I was a star in a rock an' roll band.
An' you were Lois Lane, Letty Jane.
I wasn't very good, but you were the biggest fan,
Of the man that your Momma warned you not to trust:
An', baby, look at us.
Instrumental break.

Oh, baby, look at us.

Craig Morgan - That's What I Love About Sunday
Raymond's in his Sunday best,
He's usually up to his chest in oil an' grease.
There's the Martin's walkin' in,
With that mean little freckle-faced kid,
Who broke a window last week.
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off key in the pew behind me.
That's what I love about Sunday:
Sing along as the choir sways;
Every verse of Amazin' Grace,
An' then we shake the Preacher's hand.
Go home, into your blue jeans;
Have some chicken an' some baked beans.
Pick a back yard football team,
Nothin' much of anything:
That's what I love about Sunday.
I stroll to the end of the drive,
Pick up the Sunday Times, grab my coffee cup.
It looks like Sally an' Ron, finally tied the knot,
Well, it's about time.
It's 35 cents off a ground round,
Baby. cut that coupon out!
That's what I love about Sunday:
Cat-napping on the porch swing;
You curled up next to me,
The smell of jasmine wakes us up.
Take a walk down a back road,
Tackle box and a cane pole;
Carve our names in that white oak,
An' steal a kiss as the sun fades,
That's what I love about Sunday,
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, new believers gettin' baptized,
Momma's hands raised up high,
Havin' a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face.
That's what I love about Sunday,
Oh, yeah.
That's what I love about Sunday,
Oh, yeah.
Danielle Peck - I Don't
ooh....

You say you're doin' better
For your sake I hope it's true
I wish you well
But that's all that I can do
Save your
I'm sorry's
Just leave 'em out the door
You can't make me feel guilty anymore
CHORUS
You say I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will, but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you, I don't

I know it sounds cruel
And it's really not like me, but
You've put me in a place
I never thought I'd be
These tears I'm crying
Are just tears of goodbye
I hope you find someone else
Somewhere in your life
Somewhere in your life
CHORUS
You say I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will, but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you, I don't
BRIDGE
I don't wanna know you still want me
Don't need to hear you can't sleep
No I don't, no I don't
CHORUS
You say I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will, but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you, Oh I know
Jesus loves you, I don't
mmhh.....
Darryl Worley - Awful, Beautiful Life
I woke up early with a poundin' in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wonderin' what I did
I said,
Lord, please forgive me for my sins.
My wife wanted to kill me, but she tried to save me first
You're goin' if I have to drag your butt to church.
I love this crazy, tragic,
Sometimes almost magic,
Awful, beautful life
I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
And made it through the Sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beer, watched a game,
and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
And my poor mother sat between'em both all night
I love this crazy, tragic,
Sometimes almost magic,
Awful, beautful life
We said a prayer for Cousin Michael in Iraq
We're all aware that he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he loved to be a soldier more than most
I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life is like a roller coaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or I might live on for years
I love this crazy, tragic,
Sometimes almost magic,
Awful, beautful life
I love this crazy, tragic,
Sometimes almost magic,
Awful, beautful life
Alright
It's a beautiful life
Awful, beautiful, life
I love this life
It's a beautiful life
Darryl Worley - Have You Forgotten?
I hear people saying we don't need this war
I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start preaching
Let me ask you this my friend
CHORUS 1
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away?
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
They took all the footage off my T.V.
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right
CHORUS 1
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away?
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet they remember
Just what they're fighting for
CHORUS 2
Have you forgotten all the people killed?
Some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?
Darryl Worley - If Something Should Happen
Buddy you and me go way back
Camp all June, all through highschool and before that.
So I don't mind tellin you I'm scared to death.
The doctor is goin in on the 25th
It's the same thing my daddy had
Thank God they caught it fast.
But if something should happen
Stop in some time and say hello to Catherine
You and Marianne could always keep her laughing
Because shes gonna need a lot of that
Take her out to a movie
It's gonna take sometime before shes back on her feet.
I know you think I'll be fine and I'm talkin crazy
But theres always that chance
That's why I'm askin
If something should happen
Little Nathan is growing up so fast
This November he'll turn 10
He wants to play quarterback.
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall
But I may not get to afterall
He's gonna need someone to catch a pass
And to throw it back
If something should happen
Oh promise me you'll take that boy out campin
Throw a line out in the water every now and then
Answer and questions that he has
Maybe once he gets older
You can sit and have that first cold beer together
And tell him a couple stories on his father
He's always known your my best friend.
That's why I'm askin
If something should happen
I hope I live until I'm 80
And I get to see my son get married
And have some babies
And make a million more memories with my wife.
Yeah buddy I pray alright
But if it's my time to leave
Could you watch over them for me?
If something should happen
If something should happen
If something should happen
If something should happen
If something should happen
If something should happen
David Lee Murphy - Loco
Little hula girls on the shot glass
All we need's a little salt
lime
We can plug in the hot pepper lights and pretend
That we're livin' on Key West time
I can run to the store and get some charcoal
Buy a tiki torch and fire up the grill
The whole town wants to know when I'm gonna grow up
But you know I never will
CHORUS
Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright
Nothin' wrong with a little excitement
No it makes me forget about work
'Cause I live by the rule that everything's cool
Just as long as nobody gets hurt
Hey I feel like I'm on vacation
Honey you say the word and we'll go
'Cause you're getting to me in those cut off jeans
And that T-shirt from Sloppy Joes
CHORUS
Hey I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losing my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright
Yeah the deep end might be so close
Oh that I'm hangin' on for dear life
Yeah I might be a little bit loco baby
But a little bit crazy's alright
REPEAT CHORUS
Diamond Rio - Can't Tell You
Mmmm, yeah, yeah.
I been tryin' for a long time,
To find the combination to your heart.
I been a true friend, I let you in every part of me.
Still there you are sayin' you don't know,
If I'm someone you can believe.
So what is it, baby, you can't chance?
Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you?
Can't you tell by the way that you make me move?
I'm all caught up with the things you do.
Please believe me: what else can I do?
Can't you tell I love you?
Yeah.
It's like you, you you don't feel it's a big deal,
For me to put my heart and soul on the line.
I got news, it's for me an' for you: yeah, I might be crazy.
I don't believe you'll find anybody else,
Who will give you as much as me.
Stop your second guessing girl, what's it gonna be?
Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you?
Can't you tell by the way that you make me move?
I'm all caught up with the things you do.
Please believe me: what else can I do?
Can't you tell I love you?
Yeah.
Instrumental break.
When you hold me; when you kiss me;
When you whisper my name in the night.
When you say you can't resist me,
What's left to analyse?
Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you?
Can't you tell by the way that you make me move?
I'm all caught up with the things you do.
Please believe me: what else can I do?
Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you?
Can't you tell that you make me move?
I'm all caught up with the things you do.
Please believe me: what else can I do?
Can't you tell I love you?
Oh, I love you.

Dierks Bentley - How Am I Doin'
It's strange to hear your voice, I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doin,
how I'm holding up since you've been gone
Well, how am I doing since you did,
what you've done to me
I can't lie, I sometimes cry,
when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy,
and I don't get much sleep
Baby that's how i'm doing since you did,
what you done to me
Well now wait one minute, I failed to mention,

Because it was no fun, there under your thumb,
and now that we're done
I'm getting right, every night, with every single,
every loving girl in sight
Well, how am I doing since you did,
what you've done to me

and I don't get much sleep
Baby that's how i'm doing since you did,

Well, when all my friends heard,

They took me out on the town
But then I heard our song, and I danced along,
but it felt all wrong
Cause she was sweet, she let me lead,
she never took her ever lovin eyes off me
Well, how am I doing since you did,
what you've done to me
I can't lie, I sometimes cry,
when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy,
and I don't get much sleep
Baby that's how i'm doing since you did,
what you done to me
Well I don't know what you were thinking,
running round on me
Well, now you say you're sorry.....well honey I agree
So, how are you doing since you did,

Baby how are you doing since you did what you done to me
Now how are you doing,
now that you know how I'm doing
Since you did what you done to me
Dierks Bentley - Lot Of Leavin' Left To Do
These old boots still got a lot of ground

So if you think I

Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won

So before you go and turn me on

Dierks Bentley - My Last Name
I learned how to write it, when I first started school
Some bully didn't like it, said it didn't sound too cool
So I had to hit him, and all I said when the blood came
It's my last name
Grandpa took it off to Europe, to fight the Germans in the war
It came back on some dog tags, nobody wears no more
It's written on a headstone, in the field where he was slain
It's my last name
Passed down from generations, too far back to trace
I can see all my relations, when I look into my face
May never make it famous, but I'll never bring it shame
It's my last name
Daddy always told me, far back as I recall
Son you're part of something, you represent us all
So keep it how you got it, as solid as it came
It's my last name
Repeat Chorus
So darlin if you're wonderin, why I've got you here tonight
I wanna be your husband, I want you to be my wife
Ain't got much to give you, but what I've got means everything
It's my last name
I learned how to write it, when I first started school
Dierks Bentley - What Was I Thinkin'
Well, Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her Daddy had a heart like a nine pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'
She snuck out one night an' met me by the front gate
Her Daddy came out a-wavin' that 12-gauge
We tore out the drive, he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
An' I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get going where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'
What was I thinkin'
By the county line, the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road an' kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights an' tore through a cornfield
What was I thinkin'
At the other side she was hollerin'
faster
Took a dirt road, had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky-tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late

When a mountain of a man with a
born to kill
tattoo
Tried to cut in, I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside, hood slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'
I finally got her home at a half past two, later
Daddy's in a long chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin'
Oh, what was I thinkin'
Oh, what was I thinkin'
Then she gave a come an' get me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again
'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get going, where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
Yeah, I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinkin'
What was I thinkin'
I know what I was feelin', but what was I thinkin'
Guess I was thinkin' 'bout that tank top...
Dixie Chicks - Mississippi
Every step of the way
We walk the line
Your days are numbered
So are mine
Time is piling up
We struggle and we scrape
All boxed in
Nowhere to escape
The city's just a jungle
More games to play
I'm trapped in the heart of it
Trying to get away
I was raised in the country
Been working in the town
I been in trouble since I
Set my suitcase down
I ain't got nothing for you
I had nothing before
Don't even have anything
For myself anymore
Sky's full of fire
And the rain is pouring down
There's nothing you can sell me
So I'll see you around
All my powers of expression
And thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice
Reason or rhyme
There's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long
The devil's in the alley, the mule kickin' in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I've heard it all
I was thinking about the things that you said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in your bed
Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feel like a stranger nobody sees
So many things we never will undo
I know you're sorry, well I'm sorry too
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind
Well I got here, following the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
There's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Well my ship's been split to splinters; it's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, and smiling's free
I've got nothing but affection for those who've sailed with me
Everybody's moving if they ain't already there
Everybody's got to move somewhere
Well stick with me baby anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine
The emptiness is endless, gold is gray
You can always go back, but you can't go back all the way
Well there's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Yeah the only thing that I did wrong
Was stayed in Mississippi a day too long
The only thing that I did wrong
Was stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Dixie Chicks - Travelin' Soldier
Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth at a cafe there
Gave his order to the girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she gave him a smile
So he said would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me I'm feelin' a little low
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I've got no one to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?
CHORUS:
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of the travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home
So the letters came
From an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told his heart
It might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said when it's gettin kinda tough over here
I think about that day sittin' down at the pier
And close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Now don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while
CHORUS
(Martie's fiddle break - Emily's dobro break)
One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said folks would you bow your heads
For the list of local Vietnam dead
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was the piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read and no one really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
CHORUS
Dusty Drake - I Am The Working Man
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I cut my teeth on an old lawn-mower,
Cleanin' out gutters, doin' other people's chores.
After school. weekends an' holidays.
Yeah, ever since then, all I've known,
Is my nose on fire from the grindstone,
A lifetime built on an hourly wage.
Muscled arms an' calloused hands:
I am the workin' man.
The sun comes up, the sun goes down,
Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round.
Blazin' hot, freezin' cold:
No matter what, it still goes on.
Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin',
Somebody's gotta fix it:
I am the workin' man,
Yes, I am.
Now I've laid asphalt an' I've laid brick:
I've hung sheet, rock and shovelled sh**,
Eat my lunch down at the Kwickie-Mart.
Oh, I fill the potholes on easy-street,
So show some respect when you look at me.
I'm just out here tryin' to do my part.
An' I sleep good when the day comes to an end,
'Cause I am the workin' man.
The sun comes up, the sun goes down,
Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round.
Blazin' hot, freezin' cold:
No matter what, it still goes on.
Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin',
Somebody's gotta fix it:
I am the workin' man.
I can swing a hammer, turn a wrench,
Build a tower, dig a ditch,
Drive a truck that shakes the earth,
Somebody's gotta do the dirty work.
The sun comes up, the sun goes down,
Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round.
Blazin' hot, freezin' cold:
No matter what, it still goes on.
Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin',
Somebody's gotta fix it:
I am...
I am the workin' man.
Yes I am,
Oh. the workin' man.
Dusty Drake - One Last Time
When she picked up the telephone
His voice came on the line
She said this can't be happening
And tears fell from her eyes
She said 'What am I supposed to do
I can't handle losing you?'
He said 'I just had to call and say goodbye
One last time'
He said 'There are some things in this life
That are out of our control
Like who we fall in love with
And when it's time to go'
She said 'What about the plans we had'
He said 'This connection's gettin' bad
Now, c'mon baby let me hear you smilev One last time'
She started to apologize for
All the things that she'd done wrong
She said 'I would've loved you better
If only I'd known'
He said 'You were the perfect wife
Promise me you'll go on with your life'
She says 'The boys won't understand'
He says 'Tell them Daddy loves them and Be strong'
He said 'Hon, I've gotta go'
She said 'Don't you dare hang up
There's so many things I need to say
I love you so much
It was almost like she felt him leave
She cried out 'Can you still hear me'
She fell down on the kitchen floor
When the signal died
As the pilot tried to pull out of the dive
One Last ....
Dwight Yoakam - Intentional Heartache
She drove South I-95 straight though Carolina
She didn
t use no damn map to find her way
She pulled off on the state route just north of Charlotte
And took mostly country roads the rest of the day
She said I
ll give him an intentional heartache
That
ll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me
Would you all step back so a girl might to get started
And he won
t have to look twice to see
She drove up across the yard and though his momma
s garden
Didn
t touch the brakes, she slammed right into his Chevrolet
Tossed out his clothes, boots, bud cap, and signed Dale Jr. poster
Then shot the whole mess neon green with a can of Dupont spray

She said I
ll give you an intentional heartache
That
ll hurt a lot worse than the one that you left in me
And tell your little tramp to step back so your ex wife can get started
And you won
t have to look twice to see
Just watch this
Then she sprayed that Bud cap bright green
Said Connie put that can of spray paint down
Just watch this
Then she pulled them Nakona boots out, sprayed them neon too
Put the can down Connie
She give it hell with that can of spray paint
He kept yelling at her just put the can down
So she sprayed him
Then she did a dance on top of that Dale Jr. poster
Just kind of a hoochie coochie
Alright Connie
He said I saw you Connie, now put it down
Just watch this, she run over to the passenger side of that Monte Carlo
And she sprayed tramp
On the hood on the back of the house
We tried to call her sister
What was that girls name
Said you gotta come get this girl
Nancy, I think
She said watch this
Said Lookee here lookee here, watch this
She run that girl back up on the porch
Screamin' at her tramp this
Oh yeah
She give him an intentional heartache
Alright, alright Connie I heard you
His momma was crying in there on the phone
His daddy said
I told you that girl was gonna get like that
She said watch this, here
Faith Hill - It Matters to Me
Baby tell me where'd you ever learn
To fight without sayin' a word
Then waltz back into my life
Like it's all gonna be alright
Don't you know how much it hurts
When we don't talk
When we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love
It matters to me
When I don't know what to say
Don't know what to do
Don't know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see
It matters to me
Maybe I still don't understand
The distance between a woman and a man
So tell me how far it is
And how you can love like this
'Cause I'm not sure I can
When we don't talk
When we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love
It matters to me
When I don't know what to say
Don't know what to do
Don't know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see
It matters to me
Faith Hill - Like We Never Loved At All
You never looked so good
as you did last night,
underneath the city lights,
there walking with your friend,
laughing at the moon.
I swear you looked right through me.
But I
m still living with your goodbye,
and you
re just going on with your life.
How can you just walk on by
without one tear in your eye?
Don
t you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that
s just your way
of dealing with the pain,
forgetting everything
between our rise and fall
like we never loved at all.
You, I hear you
re doing fine.
Seems like you
re doing well
as far as I can tell.
Time is leaving us behind,
(time
leaving us behind)
another week has passed
and still I haven
t laughed yet.
So tell me, what your secret is
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
to letting go, letting go like you did,
like you did.
How can you just walk on by
without one tear in your eye?
Don
t you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that
s just your way
of dealing with the pain,
forgetting everything
between our rise and fall
like we never loved at all.
Did you forget the magic?
Did you forget the passion?
Oh, and did you ever miss me,
and long to kiss me?
Oh baby, baby.
Maybe that
s just your way
of dealing with the pain,
forgetting everything
between our rise and fall
like we never loved at all.
Garth Brooks - Friends In Low Places
Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said, honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places.
Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places.
Garth Brooks - Good Ride Cowboy
From the hills of Kaycee, Wyoming
Where life's wooly and wild
There's a Navy brat in a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile
And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy's song
We were much too young, havin' too much fun
As we all sang along
We sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it!
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride
From gold buckles to gold records
Once again he was spinnin' 'round
Took the whole world on
And he turned us on to that Western Underground
And from Bareback Jack to This Cowboy's Hat
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down from town to town
Like children running thru the rain
We sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it!
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride
We sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it!
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride
When we cross that river Jordan,
With St Peter on the other side
Singin' Good Ride Cowboy, Good Ride!
Say Good Ride Cowboy, Good Ride!
Gary Allan - A Showman's Life
A showman
s life,
Is a smokey bar,
And the fevered chase,
Of a tiny star,
It
s a hotel room,
And a lonely wife,
From what I
ve seen,
Of a showman
s life,
Nobody told me about this part,
They told me all about the pretty girls,
And the wine,
And the money,
And the good times,
There
s no mention of,
All the wear and tear,
On an old honky tonker
s heart,
Well I might of known it,
But nobody told me about this part,
A boy will dream,
As children do,
Of a great white way,
Until the dream comes true,
And a phony smile,
In a colored light,
Is all there is,
To a showman
s life,
Nobody told me about this part,
Nobody told me about this part,
They told me all about the pretty girls,
And the wine,
And the money,
And the good times,
There
s no mention of,
All the wear and tear,
On an old honky tonker
s heart,
Well I might of known it,
But nobody told me about this part,
But nobody told me about this part,
Nobody told me about this part,
They told me all about the pretty girls,
And the wine,
And the money,
And the good times,
There

All the wear and tear,
On an old honky tonker

Well I might of known it,
But nobody told me about this part,

Gary Allan - Adobe Walls
Buenos noches senorita, I'm mighty pleased to meet ya
Maybe you and I could sit a spell and talk
I'm new to Santa Fe, I just rode into town today
Thought I'd spend some time in these adobe walls
It's dark in this cantina, it's a wonder that I seen ya
Sittin' without any company at all
I was wondering if we might dance away this lonely night
Like two shadows on these old adobe walls
I hear Celito Lindo softly playing
As I take you in my arms and hold you close
Though I don't understand a word you're saying
Your brown eyes tell me all I need to know
These walls have stood for ages and though time still turns its pages
Hearts are still the same when night begins to fall
Sure as there are stars above we're not the first to fall in love
That's the magic of these old adobe walls
I hear Celito Lindo softly playing
As I take you in my arms and hold you close
Though I don't understand a word you're saying
Your brown eyes tell me all I need to know
These walls have stood for ages
And though time still turns its pages
Hearts are still the same when night begins to fall
As sure as there are stars above
We're not the first to fall in love
That's the magic of these old adobe walls
As sure as there are stars above
We're not the first to fall in love
That's the magic of these old adobe walls
Gary Allan - Alright Guy
You know just the other morning
I was hanging around in my house
I had that old book with picutres of Madonna naked
And I was checkin' it out
Just then a friend of mine came to the door
She said she never pegged me for a scumbag before
Said she didn't ever want to see me no more
And I still don't why/
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
Well I just want to live until I gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm alright
This one time for medicinal purposes they forced me to smoke some dope
I'm pretty sure I can still be the President
But I dont think I'll ever get to be the Pope
Well I get wild and I know I get drunk
It's not like I got a bunch of bodies in my trunk
My old man used to call me a no-good punk
And I still dont know why
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
Well I just want to live until I gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm alright
You know just the other night
The cops pulled me over outside the bar
When they turned on their lights
And they ordered me out my car
Man I was only kiddin' when I called 'em a couple of dicks
But still they made me do the stupid human tricks
Now I'm stuck in this jail with a bunch of dumb hicks
And I still don't know why
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
Well I just want to live until I gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm alright

Gary Allan - I Don't Look Back
I was born to travel down blue highways
I never seem to learn much from my past
I don't make excuses for my mistakes
I take each day and I live it
Like it was my last
I don't look back
One foot in front of the other
On this one way track I don't look back
I live my life my way
I don't look back
I'm sure there's memories I've missed out on
There's been a couple of loves I've left behind
I haven't found a heart hat I can count on
But don't feel sorry for me
I ain't the lonesome kind
I don't look back
One foot in front of the other
On this one way track
I don't look back
I live my life my way
I don't look back
No I don't look back
I don't look back
One foot in front of the other
On this one way track
I don't look back
I live my life my way
I don't look back
I live my life my way
I don't look back
No I don't look back
No, no I don't look back
I don't look back
Gary Allan - I'm Doin' My Best
Single six months yesterday
Thought I oughta celebrate
So I went down to grab a couple beers
And I got so drunk I ripped my pants
I asked the bouncer for a dance
I thanked him as he threw me out
I woke up at a Waffle House
With a shiner and a wild brunette
She don
t know my real name yet
Well no I ain
t over you
But I
m doin
my best
Every day and every night
Hangin
on by a thread
That
s stretched just a little too tight
If I can
t find some peace of mind
I
ll take what I can get
I ain
t doin
much good
But I
m doin
my best
I decided I
d get smart
And have a long talk with my heart
At some quiet spot outside of town
So I took my best friend
s Pontiac
I drove it like a maniac
Right into the reservoir
I guess we ain
t best friends no more
Just my luck a cop came by
Who I beat up in junior high
He said I better have a good excuse
I said I
m doin
my best
Every day and every night
Hangin
on by a thread
That
s stretched just a little too tight
If I can
t find some peace of mind
I
ll take what I can get
I ain
t doin
much good
But I
m doin
my best
Some day I just might join the human race again
If I can ever find a place to show my face again
Yeah I'm doin' my best
I said I
m doin
my best
Every day and every night
Hangin
on by a thread
That
s stretched just a little too tight
If I can
t find some peace of mind
I
ll take what I can get
I ain
t doin
much good
But I
m doin

I'm doin' my best

Gary Allan - Man Of Me
Well high school got me educated
Still when I graduated
I didn't have a clue
Did a stand in the Navy
They did they're best to break me
Somehow I made it through
I've had some hard knocks
I've been around the block
But baby I believe
That love and you made a man of me
Raising hell racing cars
Closing down the local bars
That what I used to do
Family told me settle down
Find yourself some solid ground
Where you can put down some roots
Back then I thought love
Was only sissy stuff
But now I see
That love and you made a man of me
Love and you made a man of me
Don't know what it is you do
But everytime I'm holding you
I know what my heart is for
I'm the one you lean on
Gotta be strong
It's not just about me anymore
Well goodbye to my blind and imature days
Love and you made a man of me
Made a man of me, yeah
Made a man of me, wow
I'd still be only lost and lonely
Can't ya see
That love and you made a man of me
Love and you made a man of me
Ya made a man of me
Man of me, yeah
Gary Allan - Man To Man
You're throwin' around a lot of serious accusations
Ain't too hard to tell what you're insinuatin'
You think I'm the one who stole her away
And if not fo rme she'd still be yours today
We're both men here so why play games
Why don't we call a spade a spade
Man to man
Tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you
Man to man
Look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her
Why'd you make her cry
Man to man
Who cheated who
You're the one to blame
Tell me it ain't true
Man to man
Man to man
Well you think al you anger is justified
Me, I think, it's just your wounded pride
What did you really think she was gonna do
She's a real woman, not a doormat for you
You want her back, but it's too late
Why don't we just cut to the chase
Man to man
Tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you
Man to man
Look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her
Why'd you make her cry
Man to man
Who cheated who
You're the one to blame
Tell me it ain't true
Man to man
Man to man
Tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you
Man to man
Look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her
Why'd you make her cry
Man to man
Who cheated who
You're the one to blame
Tell me it ain't true
Man to man
Man to man
Man to man...
Gary Allan - Nothing On But The Radio
I sure do hope this is a long night,
Cause I
ve never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes I fall in,
A little more and more,
Looks like we started us a fire,
Wrapped up in flames of desire,
With every touch their burning higher,
Two shadows dancing on the wall,
With nothing on but the radio,
Feel the music playing soft and slow,
You and me and the lights down low,
With nothing on but the radio
We
ll fall asleep here in the moonlight,
In tangled sheets we
ll be here all night,
And when we wake up in the morning,
We might stay like this all day,
Two people meant to be together,
Two lovers dreaming of forever,
And it just keeps on getting better,
With every tender little kiss,
With nothing on but the radio,
Feel the music playing soft and slow,
You and me and the lights down low,
With nothing on but the radio
Two people meant to be together,
Two lovers dreaming of forever,
And it just keeps on getting better,
With nothing on but the radio,
Feel the music playing soft and slow,
You and me and the lights down low,
With nothing on but the radio
You and me and the lights down low,
With nothing on but the radio
Gary Allan - See If I Care
I saw you walking down the street last night,
I saw him walking by your side,
I saw the way he stopped and held you tight,
I saw the look in your eyes,
Go on and tell him that you love him,
Go on and show him he
s the one,
Go on and give him every sacred thing that you used to save for us,
And see if I care,
Look at the way you
re tearing me apart baby,
See if I care,
Look at the tears falling in this heart baby,
Go on go on go on,
Yeah go on go on go on,
And see if I care,
I still can hear the way you whisper,
Softly in my ear,
I lay awake and I remember the way it felt to hold you near,
Go on and run your fingers through his hair,
Go on and lay by his side,
Go on and wrap him in your dark surrender,
And all your tender lies,
And see if I care,
Look at the way you
re tearing me apart baby,
See if I care,
Look at the tears falling in this heart baby,

Yeah go on go on go on,
Well go on,
And see if I care
See if I care......
See if I care.....
See if I care.......
Gary Allan - Songs About Rain
Well this town has closed down way too early,
And there
s nothing to do,
So I
m driving around in circles,
And I
m thinking about you,
Today I heard you got a new last name,
Sure didn
t know it was gonna hit me this way,
And the radio just keeps on playing all these songs about rain
Now there
s all kind of songs about babies and love that goes right,
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight,
Hey I hope it
s sunny wherever you are,
But that
s sure not the picture tonight in my car,
And it sure ain
t easing my pain all these songs like,
Rainy Night In Georgia,
and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again,
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain,
They go on and on,
And there
s no two the same,
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain,
Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I
m not,
Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got,
Guess I
ll never know what could have been,
Sure ain
t helping this mood that I
m in,
If their gonna keep on playing me songs like,
Rainy Night In Georgia,
and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again,
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain,
They go on and on,
And there
s no two the same,
Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain,
All these songs about rain,
Songs about rain.......
Gary Allan - The Devil's Candy
Smoky old bars, bright neon lights
Good ole boys and girls of the night
An ice cold beer and a good shot of brandy
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy
And I've fought it all my life
And the battle's now a war
But I'll get up tomorrow
And I'll fight it all once more
I want to do what's right
But I'll never understand me
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy
Well I've played the cards, and I've rolled the dice
Well I gave up heaven for a fool's paradise
I once lost an angel when a bad girl was handy
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy
And I've fought it all my life
And the battle's now a war
But I'll get up tomorrow
And I'll fight it all once more
I want to do what's right
But I'll never understand me
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy
I want to do what's right
But I'll never understand me
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy
Yes I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy
Gary Allan - The One
No rush though I need your touch
I won't rush your heart
Until you feel on solid ground
Until your strength is found, girl
I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm
the one
Somebody else was here before
He treated you unkind
And broken wings need time to heal
Before a heart can fly, girl
I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm
the one
Trust in me and you'll find a heart so true
All I want to do is give the best of me to you
And stand beside you
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm
the one
Gary Allan - Tough Little Boys
I never once, backed down from a punch.
I'd take it square on the chin.
Well I found out fast a bullys just that and you got to
                      stand up to him.
So I didn't cry when I got a black eye as bad as it hurt
                      I just grinned.
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again.
Scared me to death when took your first steps,
Well I'd fall everytime you fell down.
Your first day of school,
I cried like a fool, I followed your school bus to town.
Well I didn't cry when ol Yeller died
at least not in front of my friends.
But when tough little boys grow up to be
Dads they turn into big babies again.
Well I'm a grown man and as strong as I am.
Well sometimes it's hard to believe,
One little girl with little blonde curls can totally terrify
                      me.
If you were to ask my wife would just laugh ,
she'd say I know all about men,
how tough little boys grow up to be Dads
they turn into big babies again.
Well I know one day I'll give you away
and I'm goin to stand there and smile.
When I get home and I'm all alone,
I'll sit in your room for awhile.
Cause when tough little boys grow up to be
Dads they turn into big babies again
Gary Allan - What I'd Say
Talkin' to the mirror, whispering your name
It's just like you were here, you'd think I was insane
I hold these conversations in the silence of my room
Rehearsing all the things I'd say should I run into you
How's it goin', might be what I'd say
Well you broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or God I've missed you
Since you went away
You're lookin' well
Or go to hell
Might be what I'd say
There's time I've been so angry
I could put my fist right through the wall
And then there's times I've come so close
To givin' you a call
I love you and I hate you
All at the same time
Then I pray you'll come back to me
Before I lose my mind
How's it goin', might be what I'd say
Well you broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or God I've missed you
Since you went away
You're lookin' well
Or go to hell
Might be what I'd say
Or maybe, God I've missed you
Since you went away
You're lookin' well
Or go to hell
Might be what I'd say
Gary Allan - What Would Willie Do
I was lost in trouble and strife, I heard a voice and it changed my life
And now it's a brand new day, and I ain't afraid to say
You're not alone when you're down and out
And I think you know who I'm talking about
When I don't know how I'll get through
I ask myself what would Willie do
What would Willie do, well he'd travel so far with nothing but a song and his old guitar
And a tour bus and some semi-trucks, thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
Well he loves all the people, the ugly and the randy
If you don't believe me take a look at the family
And they'll tell you that it's true
When skies are gray what would Willie do
Well long ago he came unto us, his words were simple but they went right through us
And the whole world sang along, but then they didn't want to hear his songs
He was gone and we thought we'd lost him
But he grew his hair and he moved to Austin
And all of the people smiled, they came to hear him sing from miles
Like a miracle all those rednecks and hippies
From New York City down to Mississippi
Stood together and raised a brew
When it's all gone wrong what would Willie do
You know sometimes I wonder when I ain't gettin' nowhere
What would old Willie do when it all gets too much to bear
And I can see him on his lonely old tour bus
And he's got his problems just like any of us
Well he'd just take a deep breath and then he'd let it all go
And he'd take another deep breath and let it all go
And he'd take another deep breath...and he'd hold it
Ah and I bet he'd feel hungry in a way that seems strange
Yeah hungry for all the things that he just can't change
Like the time he passed out in is own bedroom
And his wife sewed him up in the sheets and beat him with a broom and he forgave her
And you think that's rough, well then the IRS came and they took away all of his stuff
They took his golf course and his recording studio, and he just went out and did another show
So when it's all coming down on you
You better ask yourself what would Willie do
What would Willie do, well he'd take a little time
And talk to old rooser as he'd drive on down the line
And there's millions down that road, and with a word he's gonna lighten their load
He loves all the people no matter their races
Hell he even had a hit country song with Julio Iglesias
And that ain't easy to do, so when it's all too much, what would Willie
When the game gets tough what would Willie
When they call your bluff what would Willie do
Gary Allan - What's On My Mind
I can't have this conversation
Without lots of reservations on the line
If there's a way to slip around it
Then I'm bound to get around it one more time
Honey you are so persuasive
But it makes me more evasive when you pry
You can label me elusive
But the facts are inconclusive at this time
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I don't mean to drive you crazy
Comin' off all vague and hazy just because
I don't have an answer for you
I just wouldn't want to bore you if it does
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
Because you can't handle what's on my mind
Gary Allan - You Don't Know A Thing About Me
To you I
m just the man who let you down,
The one who never gave you what you need,
It
s true I wasn
t always around,
Back when you were reaching out for me,
I know you think I didn
t care,
You say I
m just the hurting kind,
And I know you think my heart wasn
t there,
But I
m begging you to think it through one more time,
Cause you don
t know a thing about me,
If you don
t know how much I miss you,
And you don
t know a thing about me,
Unless you know how much I need to be with you,
Well I see the mistakes I made,
The way I acted carelessly,
But if you don
t know how much I need your forgiveness,
Then you don
t know a thing about me,
If I could just go back and make it right,
And take the tears away you know I would,
I
ve come to you with no excuse tonight,
Just a prayer that I
ll be understood,
You tell me that I
m never gonna change,
I
ll always be the same old guy,
You think there
s nothing left for us to say,
Before you write me off take a look in my eyes,
Cause you don
t know a thing about me,
If you don
t know how much I miss you,
And you don
t know a thing about me,
Unless you know how much I need to be with you,
Well I see the mistakes I made,
The way I acted carelessly,
But if you don
t know how much I need your forgiveness,
Then you don
t know a thing about me,
If you don
t know how much I need your forgiveness,
Then you don
t know a thing about me,
No you don
t know a thing about me,
You don
t know a thing about me,
Well you don
t know a thing about me......
George Canyon - Good Day To Ride
Every morning when I wake up
I pour coffee in my cup
And I look out on the fields
Of the land that I call home
And if there's no chance of rain
And I need to get away
I'll grab a saddle
And be long, long gone

Looks like a good day to ride
Underneath this big warm sun
Looks like a good day
To let this old boy fly
Loose on the reins and on the run
To a blue and endless sky
Looks like a good day to ride
There's a world that's in a race
For some money and some fame
But out here there's nothin'
All I need is what I have
So when I wanna free my mind
From the concrete in the sides
I head for the mountains
Back to who I am

Looks like a good day to ride
Underneath this big warm sun
Looks like a good day
To let this old boy fly
Loose on the reins and on the run
To a blue and endless sky
Looks like a good day to ride
Wow

Looks like a good day to ride
Underneath this big warm sun
Looks like a good day
To let this old boy fly
Loose on the reins and on the run
To a blue and endless sky
Looks like a good day to ride
Looks like a good day to ride, yeah
George Canyon - I'll Never Do Better Than You
Some day I'm gonna drive me a faster car
Park in front of a house with a bigger yard
I'm gonna break my back, I'm gonna bust my tail
Taking everything another notch upscale
I won't fail
But I'll never, ever do better than you
When it comes to your love, baby
I've already done the best I can do
It's so true
I'll never, ever do better than you
One day I'm gonna hit a little bigger lick
And I'll bring you home an even bigger check
One morning fortune's gonna smile on me
I'm gonna go even higher than I aim to be
Wait and see
(Chorus 2x)
But I'll never, ever do better than you
When it comes to your love, baby
I've already done the best I can do
It's so true
I'll never, ever do better than you
Oh, there's nothing better than you
Never better than you
George Canyon - Letting Go
Lonely sound of distant thunder
Stirs my restless sleep
And the dream that i was lost in
Slips away
Of a young son and his mama
So innocent back then
Would she even reckognise her boy today

Cause i have fought into the darkness
And i've spilled blood, with these 2 hands
And in my heart I wish i could believe
That who i was, is who i am
I've crossed mountains, hills, and valleys
From sea to shining sea
Barren sands to blinding snow
I held my brother as he laid dieing
Beside me in some field
Said a prayer, and let him go

And i have fought into the darkness
I've spilled blood, with these 2 hands
And in my heart I wish i could believe
That who i was, is who i am
I'm letting go (i'm letting go)
Letting go (i'm letting go)
Well i'm letting go (i'm letting go)
Letting go (i'm letting go)
Now with all my trials behind me
I'm so blessed to cast my eyes
On my family and my home
And with faith i faced my demons
When God was on our side
All that's left, is letting go
I'm letting go (i'm letting go)
Letting go (i'm letting, letting go)
Well i'm letting go (i'm letting go)
Letting go (i'm letting, letting go)
George Canyon - My Name
It
s cold in here fells like everything
s upside down
I can feel you talking but I can barley make out the sound
I been kicking around these parts, feels like a year
I
m gonna change this world if I ever get out of here
She wants to dress me in pink, paint
s my bedroom blue
And I just laugh to myself, because only I know the truth
This love is my only emotion
Haven
t learned any fear any pain
It
s kind of funny with all this commotion
I guess they
ve got me, to blame
And they don
t even know my name
And they don
t even know my name
Well I
ve never felt so ready, think it
s finally time
Cause that big old world is waiting, and it
s mine all mine
Just then everything got real quiet, it got real bright
And a man took my hand said don
t worry, your mommas gonna be alright
Then he opened the gate,
I followed him in
Said you can wait right, here till it
s your turn again
And his love is the one true emotion
Heaven knows no fear no pain
I never got to set my wheels in motion
But they loved me just the same
And they never even knew name
Didn
t even know my name
You loved me just the same
And you didn
t even know my name
George Strait - As Far As It Goes
Lately I
ve found myself fallin
Deeper in love with you
I

Who gets swept away
So here
s what I
m gonna do
I
m gonna give you this heart of mine
But that
s where I draw the line
Chorus:
I
m only gonna give you everything
Take it a mile beyond the end of the road
I
m gonna love you one day past forever
But that
s as far as it goes
I know it may not sound like much
But baby, make no mistake
I
m gonna treat you with more tenderness
Than any one woman can take
I
m gonna make all your dreams come true
But after that, baby, I
m through
Repeat Chorus
You
ve got your limits, I
ve got mine
I
m only gonna go the distance
Time after time
Repeat Chorus
But that
s as far as it goes
George Strait - Cowboys Like Us
I take off time to time

We burn up that road to Mexico
Blend in with the desert
Just we amigos

George Strait - Desperately
Every night it
s the same
I hear you callin
my name
You
re lyin
next to me
I give into your charms
You disappear in my arms
I realize it
s just a dream, but
Chorus:
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love
And now I
Shake the sleep from my head
And try to crawl out of bed
Today is just another day

Pretend that everything

Chorus
And now I

It

George Strait - Don't Tell Me You're Not In Love
I know you're ready you show all the signs
Your eyes sparkle oh how they shine
But you keep saying you can't take another heartache
The way you hold me the way that you move
Your feelings keep showing through
You can't hide it it's written all over your face
Don't tell me you're not in love
When your heart beats like it does
You trembling body tells on you
Each time we touch
You can tell you're afraid
I am too and that's okay
I got eyes I can see
Baby don't tell me you're not in love
Sweet love songs bring you to tears
Come on baby don't hide your fear
Let your lips say what your heart already knows
Your denial is last thing to fall
The only brick left holding the wall
Don't hold back speak with your heart and your soul
Don't tell me you're not in love
When your heart beats like it does
You trembling body tells on you
Each time we touch
You can tell you're afraid
I am too and that's okay
I got eyes I can see
Baby don't tell me you're not in love
George Strait - Four Down And Twelve Across
I don

Sometimes I hate it
Sometimes I love it
Girl, this relationship we

To say the least it
s puzzlin
Like a crossword puzzle
Fill in the blanks
Chorus:
What
s four down and twelve across
Two letter synonym for lost That
s me
And a three letter word
That rhymes with through
Oh I get it, that
s you
Never believed in horoscopes
But to the left of the ad
For a new dishwashin
soap

For a troubled couple lost in paradise
In the Living section

Two letter synonym for lost
That

And a three letter word
That rhymes with through

We try and try
For the life of me, why did we give up

And I'll be here if you want to party
From nine in the morning 'til twelve at night
Two miles from town 'cross the railroad track
Turn right at the light and park in the back
You're always welcome don't forget to drop in
Old Charley done time two years in the pen
Well the beat goes on there's a hardwood floor
And the sound of laughter runnin' out the door
Wall to wall women plenty of ice-cold beer
And thing you're after you can find it here
Two miles from town 'cross the railroad track
Turn right at the light and park in the back
You're always welcome don't forget to drop in
Old Charley done time two years in the pen
George Strait - Heaven Is Missing An Angel
You came into my life like an answer to a prayer
Like a star that falls from the sky right out of thin air
Some might say it
s a miracle or a dream come true
But from that day I always knew
Chorus:
Heaven is missing an angel
That
s the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you

George Strait - Honkytonkville
Thought I
d go crazy when you said goodbye
I didn
t have that far to go
But I made a wrong turn somewhere in the night
Down a long and lonely road
Chorus:
To Honkytonkville, an ideal
Home away from home sweet home
Honkytonkville where I don
t feel
A thing since you
ve been gone
Where the future
s always bright
In the glow of neon lights
Livin
high on Barstool Hill in Honkytonkville
There
s friendly faces everywhere I turn
Droppin
quarters in the slot
Lord knows that we
ve all got memories to burn
And that
s why that jukebox plays around the clock
Repeat Chorus
Livin
high on Barstool Hill in Honkytonkville
George Strait - I Found Jesus On The Jailhouse Floor
There once was a time when I was dead inside
I cussed the Lord for the day I was born
And prayed to the Devil to die
Just when I thought the Devil had won
Someone opened up the door
The King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
Chorus:
Now, he broke the chains that bound me, and now I
m free
Today I
m right where Mama
Prayed I
d be
I
m down on my knees
Now I believe
What Mama knew for sure
He
s King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
Now, if you
re in trouble friend, let me tell you what to do
I
ll tell you what he
s done for me
And I know what he
ll do for you
It makes no difference what you
ve done
You
ve a friend in the One that I adore
The King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
Repeat Chorus
He
s King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
George Strait - I Hate Everything
He was sitting there beside me
Throwin' doubles down when he ordered up his third
He looked around, then he looked at me
And said I do believe I oughta have one more.
I hate this bar and I hate to drink,
But on second thought, tonight I think I hate everything.
Then he opened up his billfold and threw a 20 down
And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground
And I picked it up he said Thank ya bud.
I put it in his hand, He said I probably oughta throw
This one away, 'cause she's the reason I feel this way,
I hate everything.
I hate my job, and I hate my life.
If it werent for my two kids, I'd hate my ex-wife.
I know I should move on and try to start again,
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.
Then he shook his head and looked down at his ring,
And said I hate everything.
He said, That one bedroom apartment where I get my mail,
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail,
With a swimming pool and a parking lot view. Man, it's just great!
I hate summer, winter, fall, and spring,
Red and yellow, purple, blue and green.
I hate everything.
I hate my job, and I hate my life.
If it werent for my two kids, I'd hate my ex-wife.
I know I should move on and try to start again,
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.
Then he shook his head and looked down at his ring,
And said I hate everything.
So I pulled out my phone and I called my house
I said Babe, I'm coming home we're gonna work this out.
I paid for his drinks and I told him Thanks!
Thanks for everything...
George Strait - Living And Living Well
Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew
There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
'Til you smiled with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet
There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you
There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
George Strait - Look Who's Back From Town
Those city lights drew you like a magnet
You were attracted to his high-falootin
crowd
I begged you not to go, but you still packed up
I
ve been expectin
you
Oh, look who
s back from town
My old truck could not compare to his Mercedes
Did it humble you when you rode back on that Greyhound
You picked a plastic rose and left a field of daisies
I
ve been expectin
you
Oh, look who
s back from town
Chorus:
What brings you back to this part of the country
Well let me guess, ol
loverboy let you down
Did he throw you away like his money
I
ve been expectin
you
Oh, look who
s back from town
Repeat Chorus
I
ve been expectin
you
Oh, look who
s back from town
George Strait - My Infinite Love
When you see a shooting star in the night
When you hear the warm wind whisper through the pines
I want you to know
Chorus:
It
ll be me and my infinite love for you
It
s just like I promised you under heaven above
It will live on long after we kiss goodbye
Forever by your side
My infinite love
When you think someone is callin
out your name
When you feel that kind of feelin
you can
t explain
Now you will know
Repeat Chorus
I want you to know
Repeat Chorus
My infinite love
My infinite love
George Strait - My Life's Been Grand
My life's been grand
I been a hand at livin' it up all the way
I've had good times and bad times and hard times and done time
But life's been a blessing every day
My life's been grand
You know I'd write home and tell 'em
But they wouldn't believe how good my luck's been
And if it ended today I've been all the way
My life's been grand
My life's been grand
George Strait - Run
If there's a plane or a bus leavin' Dallas I hope you're on it
If there's a train movin' fast down the tracks I hope you caught it
'Cause I swear out there ain't where you oughta be
So catch a ride catch a cab don't ya know I miss ya bad
But don't you walk to me
Baby run cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line you can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust I need you in a rush
So baby run
If you ain't got a suitcase get a box or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy take a truck take a Chevy
Baby just come back
There's a short cut to the highway out of town why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down go on and break it
Baby run cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line you can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust I need you in a rush
So baby run
George Strait - She Let Herself Go
He wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye.
Thought she might do some cryin': lose some sleep at night.
But he had no idea, when he hit the road,
That without him in her life, she'd let herself go.
Let herself go on a singles cruise,
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu.
Let herself go to New York City:
A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty.
When he said he didn't love her no more,
She let herself go.
She poured her heart an' soul into their three-bedroom ranch.
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironin' his pants.
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note,
And without him there to stop her, she let herself go.
Let herself go on her first blind-date:
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake.
Let herself go, buy a brand new car,
Drove down to the beach he always said was too far.
Sand sure felt good between her toes:
She let herself go on a singles cruise,
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu.
Let herself go to New York City:
A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty.
When he said he didn't love her no more,
She let herself go.
To Vegas once: Honolulu, New York City.
Came back knocked-out pretty.
George Strait - She Used To Say That To Me
Let
s take a rest
Your kisses take my breath
You are the best
It
s never been like this
Chorus:
She used to say that to me
Over and over so sweet
She
ll tell you she
ll never leave
She used to say that to me
It thrills you so
When she whispers soft and low
Please hold me tight
I need your love tonight
Repeat Chorus
I
m yours,
she sighs
And she means it at the time
But someday she
ll go
If you
re wonderin
how I know
She used to say that to me
Over and over so sweet
She
ll tell you she
ll never leave
She used to say that
She used to say that to me
Over and over so sweet
She
ll tell you she
ll never leave
She used to say that to me
She used to say that to me
George Strait - She'll Leave You With A Smile
At first she's gonna come on strong
Like She'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile
Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help love her
And all that hurtin' was more than worth it
It's written all over your face
One day you'll pass her on the street
With that guy you used to be
She'll say hello and walk on by
Then she'll leave you with a smile
Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help love her
And all that hurtin' was more than worth it
It's written all over your face
At first she's gonna come on strong
Like She'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile
Ah, she's gonna love you
She gonna leave you with a smile
Ah, she's gonna love you
She gonna leave you with a smile
George Strait - Stars On The Water
Down in Louisiana bayous by and by
A peirot pole or your natural soul
Keeps you tied to a tree high tide
Beer joint lights come on
And then crowd starts rollin' in
Pretty soon you got stars on the water
You got stars on the water
You got stars on the water
When it rains
Beaumont to Biloxi sea breeze at your door
Gypsy rains dang hurricanes
White silver sandy shores
Blue light lounge is shinin'
Why out on the pier
Makes it look just like stars on the water
Just like stars on the water
Just like stars on the water
When it rains
When it's midnight down in Mobile
Shining moon beams on the bay
They come from miles around
To dance the jukebox down
Th hear the good time sounds they play
And all across the harbor night life shinin' on
Makes you feel just like stars on the water
Just like stars on the water
Just like stars on the water
When it rains
George Strait - Tell Me Something Bad About Tulsa
Love is so beautiful
When everything is fine
But when it is like hers and mine
It lives and dies at least
Ten Thousand
Times
Chorus:
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
How those old oil wells
Smell in the wind
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
So I won
t have to go back
Believing I belong there
Again
Eyes as blue as Tulsa skis
I kept getting lost in when I met her
Hair like Oklahoma sand
I could run my hands through forever
But all good things must end
All rivers have to bend
I keep runnin
out
But she keeps pullin
me back in
REPEAT CHORUS:
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
So I won
t have to go back
Believing I belong there
Again
George Strait - The Middle Of Nowhere
Way out here you can see for miles
If there was anything to be seen
Maybe I could tell the difference between
Where I am and where I've been
So if I stare off in the distance sometimes
And get that far away look in my eye
It's that my baby went and left me out there
All alone in the middle of nowhere
Way out in the middle of nowhere
Oh nobody wants to go there
My baby's gone and she don't care
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere
Standin' at the edge of the sky
On top of a mountain so tall
Wishing to God I could fly
When I ain't even done climbing the wall
Could you help me let the teardrops roll
Awe anything to cleanse my soul
Or if you've got a single raindrop to spare
Lord I'm out in the middle of nowhere
Way out in the middle of nowhere
Oh nobody wants to go there
My baby's gone and she don't care
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere
George Strait - The Real Thing
I was on a bus comin' back to us
From Atlanta in '53
And I picked up a Rhythm
Blues magazine
Layin' underneath my seat
And I found out the stuff they'd been playin' us
Wasn't made from grits and bone
And it would take more than the Crew Cuts
And Pat Boone to take me home
I want the real thing
Give me the real thing
Make it loud I'll make you proud
Or the songs they'd sing
I don't want you under my roof with your 86 proof
Watered down ''til it tastes like tea
You're gonna pull my string
Make it the real thing
I remember old Elvis when he forgot
To remember to forget
And when young Johnny Cash hadn't seen this side of
Big River yet
And old Luther and Lewis and Perkins was pickin
And playin' them songs for me
I want the real thing
Give me the real thing
Make it loud I'll make you proud
Or the songs they'd sing
I don't want you under my roof with your 86 proof
Watered down 'til it tastes like tea
You're gonna pull my string
Make it the real thing
George Strait - The Road Less Traveled
There's a road a winding road that never ends
Full of curves lessons learned at every bend
Goin's rough unlike the straight and narrow
It's for those who go against the grain
Have no fear dare to dream of a change live to march to the beat of a
different drummer
And it all might come together
And it all might unraveled
On the road less traveled
For the road less traveled ain't for the faint of heart
For those who choose to play it safe and never stray too far
Me I want to live my life and one day leave my mark
And it all might come together
And it all come unraveled
On the road less traveled
I've chosen a pathway I may not endure
One thing's for certain nothing for sure
And it all might come together
And it all might come unraveled
On the road less traveled
For the road less traveled ain't for the faint of heart
For those who choose to play it safe and never stray too far
Me I want to live my life and one day leave my mark
And it all might come together
And it all come unraveled
On the road less traveled
There's a road winding road that never ends
George Strait - You'll Be There
Hope is an anchor and love is a ship, time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're going,
till you know where you're at
And if you can't read the stars, well you better have a map
A compass and a conscience, so you don
t get lost at sea
Or on some lonely island, where no one wants to be
From the beginning of creation, I think our maker had a plan
For us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
And let the good light guide us through the waves and the wind
To the beaches in a world where we have never been
And we'll climb up on a mountain, y'all we'll let our voices ring
Those who've never tried it, they'll be the first to sing
Whoa, my, my
I'll see you on the other side
If I make it
And it might be a long hard ride
But I
m gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don
t have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I wanna go
Where the streets are gold
Cause you'll be there
Oh, my , my
You don
t bring nothing with you here
And you can
t take nothing back
I ain
t never seen a hearse, with a luggage rack
So I've torn my knees up prayin
Scarred my back from fallin
down
Spent so much time flying high, till I
m face first in the ground
So if you're up there watchin
me, would you talk to God and say,
Tell him I might need a hand to see you both someday
Whoa, my, my
So I'll see you on the other side
If I make it
And it might be a long hard ride
But I
m gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don
t have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I wanna go
Where the streets are gold
Cause you'll be there
Oh, my , my
Cause you'll be there
Oh, my ,my
Gord Bamford - All About Her
I used to wonder what they meant
By walking the floor
Now there's grooves under my boots
And I don't wonder anymore
All those simple country songs
Have so much meaning since I lost her
They go right through my heart
Not in one ear and out the other
Like when my Daddy spun that vinyl
Of Hank Snow and Charlie Pride
It always caught Momma's attention
And she'd just break right down and cry
But I'd just listen to the pickin'
'Cause that's the only part I liked
I didn't understand the words
Now they're all about her
We went out walkin' after midnight
Now I do it alone
It seems like one day she was with me
And the next day she was gone
There's a high lonesome sound
And the melody is whistling
I remember from my childhood
When I didn't know what I was missing
Like when my Daddy spun that vinyl
Of Kitty Wells and Loretta Lynn
It always caught Momma's attention
And she'd just break right down again
But I'd just listen to the pickin'
The only part that pulled me in
I didn't understand the words
Now they're all about her
Here's to pick-up trucks and good dogs
And heartaches
I'm gonna listen to what gets me through
If that's what it takes
So now when I spin my records
Of George Strait and Tim McGraw
I close my eyes and let that lyric
Catch me when I fall
I still listen to the pickin'
Yes I do but that's not all
Now that I understand the words
And they're all about her
They're all about her
Greg Bates - Did It For The Girl
I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap
Left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash
I did it for the girl
Dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss
I did it for the girl
I dialed her up some more George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge
Big sky turnin' red
That perfect night she said she can't forget
I did it for the girl
Dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss
I did it for the girl
I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her
I did it for the girl
Dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss
I did it for the girl
Dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt, pull me through the front door
Did it for the midnight, candlelight, anything to make her mine
All mine
I did it for the girl
I did it for the girl
Gretchen Wilson - All Jacked Up
Heyahhhhhhhhh
Five of the PM rolls around, there's a
little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers and
a juke box song ringing in my ears
The next you know the bar tenders pouring, shots are flowing, got me stoning
All I really know is that I should be going,
but I'm soaking from the moment
Am all jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much.
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies when you're all jacked up
It was getting mighty close to nice o'clock,
what the hell I had one more shot.
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar,
guess I mighta musta gone a little too far.
Cause a big ole girl walked outta the blue,
10 foot 2 with a bad attitude
Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth,
guess I had it coming I deserved the due
Cos I was all jacked up, all jacked up,
Don't believe I've ever had this much.
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up.
Don't have to go home but you can't stay here,
That's what they said when I got my last beer.
Oh my God, its 2 o'clock, I can't find my keys and my trucks locked
So I grabbed a tire tool and I broke my window,
hurt my elbow got me in though
Two foot later backed into the light pole,
all the town folk got a good choke
All jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much.
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive you truck when you're all jacked up
Jacked up
(all jacked up, all jacked up)
oooooooooo
One thing I've learned when you get tore up;
Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up.
One thing I've learned when you get tore up'?
Don't drive your car
Don't start no stuff in no bar
Hell I wouldn't tell anybody where you are
When you're all jacked up
All Jacked up
All Jacked up
All Jacked up
Yeh yeh yeh yeh
Gretchen Wilson - California Girls
Well I ain't never had a problem with California
There's a lot of good women, Sacramento to Corona
But them Hollywood types, after a while wear on ya
Strutin' around in their size zeros,
Skinny little girls no meat on thier bones
Never even heard of George Jones
CHORUS
Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls
Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left, who know how to rock your world
Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken and dirty dance to Merle
Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls
There ain't nothing wrong with plastic surgery
Well, Dolly Parton never looked so good to me
Everybody oughta be exactly who they want to be
But that Paris Hilton gets under my skin
With her big fake smile and her painted on skin
Never had a chance at a real man
CHORUS
Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls
Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left, who know how to rock your world
Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken and dirty dance to Merle
Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls
CHORUS
Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls
Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left, who know how to rock your world
Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken and dirty dance to Merle
Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls

Gretchen Wilson - He Ain't Even Cold Yet
Look at her
My God she's dancin'
Out there romancin'
In her new lover's arms
If he were here
To see how she's actin'
If he could hear her Laughin'
It would brak his broken heart

'Cause he ain't even cold yet
The tears haven't dried yet
It's not written in stone yet
As far as he's concerned
He ain't even cold yet
The fire's still burnin'
She laid his love to rest
Showin' no regrets
Lord, Heain't even cold yet
If he found out
Lord, It would kill him
'Cause he's still livin'
In yesterday
Whoever tells him
That she's not grieven'
Would just be leavin'
Flowers on his grave

'Cause he ain't even cold yet
The tears haven't dried yet
It's not written in stone yet
As far as he's concerned
He ain't even cold yet
The fire's still burnin'
She laid his love to rest
Showin' no regrets
Lord, Heain't even cold yet
She laid his love to rest
Showin' no regrets
And he ain't even cold yet

Gretchen Wilson - I Don't Feel Like Loving You Today
I don't feel like loving you today,
So don't you even try to change my mind,
The best thing you can do right now,
Is just go away,
Cause I don't feel like loving you today,
I don't wanna talk about last night,
I'm angry and I haven't had much sleep,
And I'm so tired and bloodshot,
There's no tellin' what I'd say,
I don't feel like loving you today,
But you know I will anyway,
Even though we make it hard sometimes,
I'll wind up forgiving and probably loving you,
For the rest of my life,
But I don't feel like loving you today,
And I've got 16 hours left to go,
I might tell you that I'm leaving,
Even though you know I'll stay,
Cause I don't feel like loving you today,
But you know I will anyway,
Even though we make it hard sometimes,
I'll wind up forgiving and probably loving you,
For the rest of my life,
But I don't feel like loving you today,
I just don't feel like loving you today
Gretchen Wilson - Not Bad For A Bartender
I stood behing that bar till closing time
I served cold beer, warm whiskey, and Rotgut Wine
Now I'm up here on the stage
Everybody knows my name
And I can't believe how long they wait
In my autograph line

Not bad for a bartender or an eighth grade education
pretty good for a backwoods girl
who had to make it on her own
I'm on the stool side of the bar these days
Buying everyone a round
Ain't it funny how the tables turn
Not bad for a bartender
Swingin' doors and cleanin' floors is all I'd ever known
Out of nowhere somehow i gound my yello brick road
So when you're broke and paying dues
Look at me I'm living proof
And if there's hope for me
Know there's hope for you.
[Repeat Chorus]
I'm on the stool side of the bars these days
Buying everyone a round
Ain't it funny how the tables turn
Not bad for a bartender
Ain't it funny how the tables turn
Not bad for a bartender
Gretchen Wilson - One Bud Wiser

Well I'm one bud wiser than I was a minute ago
I found an equalizer that makes his memory a no show
And I won't be jonesin'
for his loving anymore
Cause I'm one bud wiser than I was a minute ago
I dropped a quarter played
Golded Ring
on the juke box
Placed my order with the guy behind the bar
And when he haded me a cold one, I said
Keep the change, Darlin'
And as I drank it down I felt the healing start.
[Repeat Chorus]
When he left me he took my brand new Silverado
I started thumbin' and I finally hitched a ride
I just came in here to drink a beer and watch the rednecks fight
Now I don't feel so bad going home alone tonight
[Repeat chorus]
And I won't be jonesin' for his lovin' any more
'Cause I'm one bud wiser than I was a minute ago
Yes I'm one bud wiser...
Gretchen Wilson - Politically Uncorrect
I'm for the low man on the toedom pole
And I'm for the underdog god bless his soul
And I'm for the guys still pulling third shift
and the single mom raising her kids
And I'm for the preacher who stay on their knees
And I'm for the sinner who finally believed
And I'm For the farmer with dirt on his hands
And the soldiers who fight for this land
And I'm for the bible
And I'm for the flag
And I'm for the working man
Me and Ol' hag
I'm just one of many who can't get no respect
Politically Uncorrect
I guess my opinion is all out of style
Don't get me started because i can get wild
And I'll make a fight for the four father's plan (That's Right)
Hell the world already knows where I stand
And I'm for the bible
And I'm for the flag
And I'm for the working man
Me and Ol' hag
I'm just one of many who can't get no respect
Politically Uncorrect
Nothing Wrong with the bible
Nothing Wrong with the flag
Nothing Wrong with the working man
Me and Ol' Hag
We're just some of many that can't get no respect
Politically Uncorrect
Politically Uncorrect
Gretchen Wilson - Raining On Me
I've been chasing rainbows all my life
Still haven't found that pot of gold
I send my prayers to heaven every night
Just close my eyes and let them go
Seems like everybody has got one up on me
Someone tell me what I'm supposed to do

Why does the sun always shine
On the other side, on the other side
Why does it always have to be
Oh raining
Always raining on me
Seems like I've been standing under the clouds
And it's always beenthat way
There ain't no silver lining to be found
Everywhere I look it's just another shade of grey
And I don't know why
And I don't know when
And I don't know where to begin
[Repeat Chorus]
I know there's a rainbow hiding just beyond the clouds
So I'll keep on keeping on
Ain't gonna let it get me down
I won't let get me down
[Repeat Chorus]
Always raining on me
Always raining on me
Always raining on me
Gretchen Wilson - Rebel Child
Rebel Child
Rebel Child.....
Rebel Child, won
t you heed my warning
One of these days the rain will come pouring
Some of those sunshine blue, sky mornings
might just turn to gray
I understand, why you do the things you do
There was a time, when I was just like you
I know right now, you think you know it all
There
s no way that you can break, no way you can fall
Rebel Child, won
t you heed my warning
One of these days the rain will come pouring
Some of those sunshine blue, sky mornings, might just turn to gray
Cuz I
ve been there and I know what your thinking
You
re flying high but someday you
ll blink and
That cloud you're on will just start sinking
Don
t wait
til it
s too late.
Oh, oh, oh Rebel Child
I know you can
t learn from my mistakes
You got your own
roads you gotta take
And they might look
like they
re paved with gold
Just remember that you
ll have to reap
all the seeds you sow
Rebel Child, won
t you heed my warning
One of these days the rain will come pouring
Some of those sunshine blue, sky mornings might just turn to gray
I
ve been there and I know what your thinking
You

That cloud you're on will just start sinking
Don

And remember life is one big lesson

Gretchen Wilson - Redneck Woman
Well I aint never
been the barbie doll type
no I can't swig that sweet champaigne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern or in a honky tonk
I want a 4 wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynard, Kid and Straight
Some people look down on my
But I don't give a rip
I stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby in on my hip
Cause I'm redneck woman
I aint no high class broad
I'm just a product of my rasin'
And I say
hey y'all
and
Yee Haw
And I keep my christmas lights on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charle Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big
Hell Yea
from the redneck girls like me
Hell Yeah
Hell Yeah
Victoria's Secret
Well thier stuff's real nice
Oh but I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal*Mart shelf half price
And still look sexy
Just as sexy
As those models on tv
No I don't need no designer tag to make my men want me
You might think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But get in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door
Hey I'm redneck woman
I aint no high class broad
I'm just a product of my rasin'
And I say
hey y'all

Gretchen Wilson - Skoal Ring

Don't need no diamond ring
Don't want a bunch of bling bling
The only thin I really need
Is a man with a SKOAL Ring
Don't have to be wined and dined
We can stay home every night
I can do without anything
Except a man with a SKOAL Ring
He works a ten hour shift and comes home right on time
He don't complain a bit when I get out of line
He ain't richand he might have a little dirt on his hands
But that worn-out circle on his jeans makes him my kind of man
[1/2 Chorus]
I've always been a bandit girl and he's a long cut man
Somehow we still get along with different colored can's
When that boy comes home from work smellin' like the farm
That berryblend on his lips still turns me on

Don't need no diamond ring
Don't want a bunch of bling bling
The only thin I really need
Is a man with a SKOAL Ring
Don't have to be wined and dined
We can stay home every night
I can do without anything
Except a man with a SKOAL Ring
The one thing that gets to me is a man with a SKOAL Ring
Gretchen Wilson - When I Think About Cheatin'
I've never done anything
That would ever bring a tear to your eye
I've never crossed the line
or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
But darling i'll admit
They're been times when i could have
The thing that kept me strong
Is the one thing that is always on My mind

When I think about cheatin'
I just think about you leavin'
And how my world would fall to pieces
If I tossed your love away
Even when i'm tempted by some stranger
Oh there's never any danger
I just think about you leavin'
When I think about cheatin'
There was a time in Abilene
When he said all the things I wanted to hear
It was hard to turn him down
Between the champaigne and the sound of whispers in my ear
But it just took one two-step with someone and I was missing you
He never had the chance cause I broke up the dance
Before the song was through

When I think about cheatin'
I just think about you leavin'
And how my world would fall to pieces
If I tossed your love away
Even when i'm tempted by some stranger
Oh there's never any danger
I just think about you leavin'
When I think about cheatin'
Hot Apple Pie - Hillbillies
Hillbillies love it in the hay
Tractors parked out in the yard
I say you and me take it down to the barn
Pull it inside and climb to the top
Spread out a blanket in a favorite spot
Pitch that pitchfork out the way
Hillbillies love it in the hay
Grab that bottle of strawberry wine
Plate full of chicken and some of that pie
We could be there all night long
You know how we get when we get it on
Up in the loft down yonder way (whatda say?)
Hillbillies love it in the hay
Let me down on a bed of gold
Roll me round til the cows come home
Drive me wild in the soft sweet grass
Hillbillies like it like that
Sun's comin up and the rooster crows
Hound dog chewin on a chicken bone (chicken bone)
You and me just havin a ball
That's a good thing that old mule can't talk (good guess)
Ain't no tellin what he might say
Hillbillies love it in the [mule noise]
HEY!
Let me down on a bed of gold
Roll me round til the cows come home
Drive me wild in the soft sweet grass (aww yes)
Hillbillies like it like that
Hey Hillbilly, Hey Hillbilly,
Hey Hillbilly, Hey Hillbilly
James Otto - Days Of Our Lives
Well, I left for work in a hurry.
I rushed out the door without sayin' goodbye.
I didn't tell her I loved her this mornin',
But I'll tell her tonight, I thought to myself.
An' as I hurried off t'wards the highway,
This truck, outta nowhere, caught me by surprise.
He missed me by inches, an' my life passed in front of my eyes.
I guess that's the reason that they say:
Dance every dance an' live each day,
As though it's your last,
An' tell those that you love how you feel,
Before it's too late.
Life is right here and now,
We only go around just one time.
So embrace 'em, don't waste 'em,
For these are the days of our lives.
Well as soon as my legs stopped a-shakin',
Took a deep breathe an' turned my car around.
Oh, I'm gonna take that vacation,
That we talked about, startin' right now.
Although I know tomorrow will be here,
Tomorrow may not always be here for me.
'Cause nothin' in life is for certain but death's guaranteed.
And that's the reason that I say:
Dance every dance an' live each day,
As though it's your last,
An' tell those that you love how you feel,
Before it's too late.
Life is right here and now,
We only go around just one time.
So embrace 'em, don't waste 'em,
For these are the days of our lives.
Instrumental break.
Yeah, life is right here and now,
We only go around just one time.
So embrace 'em, don't waste 'em,
For these are the days of our lives.
Oh, embrace 'em, don't waste 'em,
For these are the days of our lives.
Yeah
Jamie O'Neal - Somebody's Hero
She's never pulled anyone from a burning building
She's never rocked Central Park to a half a million fans, screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game
She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon ride, around the world,
No, she's just your everyday average girl (but)
She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned up knee
A little kiss is all she needs
The keeper of the cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
Bedtime stories every night
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero
She didn't get a check every week like a nine-to fiver
But she's been a waiter, and a cook and a taxi driver
For twenty years, there at home, until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition
But now her baby's movin' on, and she'll soon be missin' her
But not today, those are tears of joy runnin' down her face
She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest
It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle she walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero
Thirty years have flown right past
Her daughters' starin' at all the photographs
Of her mother, and she wishes she could be like that
Oh, but she already is
She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home
She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero
Jamie O'Neal - Trying To Find Atlantis
I hear he's out there somewhere
Been looking for him everywhere
From Rosweld to Timbuck too I thought I found him once at a jiffy lube
But it turned into a dead end so I got my oil changed and I tried again
He was a major in archeology
I was digging on him but he wasn't on me
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis
It's a mystery like the deep blue sea
You can take it you can leave it but I still believe
So I won't give up and I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis
I met a mystic down in Memphis we stood at the foot of the pyramid
He had me looking east - He had me looking west
Then he showed me a map and said I wish you the best
There was Elvis not the real one
When told me good bye he called me hun
Just another shot in the dark like Eldorado or Noah's ark
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis
It's a mystery like the deep blue sea
You can take it you can leave it but I still believe
So I won't give up and I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis

Jenkins - Blame It On Mama
When I was six or seven, Mama tucked me in,
With a lullaby and they made my eyes open wide again.
I'd lie awake an' wonder why a boy named Billy Joe,
Jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge to a river far below, oh.
Oh, blame it on Mama, an' the songs she loved singin'.
I'm not from Louisiana but that don't mean a thing.
Don't come from Alabama or hail from Tennessee,
Just blame it Mama, she sang, (She sang.)
The country into me.
I just loved to listen as she sang those story songs,
'Bout a Coat Of Many Colors, or a girl named Delta Dawn.
When The Lights Went out In Georgia, I would beg for just one more,
All about Fancy and the pretty red satin dancin' dress she wore.
Oh, blame it on Mama, an' the songs she loved singin'.
I'm not from Louisiana but that don't mean a thing.
Don't come from Alabama or hail from Tennessee,
Just blame it Mama, she sang, (She sang.)
The country into me.

I'm a Coal Miner's Daughter. (I'm a Coal Miner's Daughter.)

Stared down the barrel of a lawman's gun.
I've grown roots an' I've got claims,
To places I've never been. (Places I've never been.)
An' when I sing those songs it takes me,
Right back home again.
Oh, blame it on Mama, an' the songs she loved singin'.
I'm not from Louisiana but that don't mean a thing.
Don't come from Alabama or hail from Tennessee,
Just blame it Mama, she sang, (She sang, she sang.)
The country into me.
The country into me, yeah.
Jessi Alexander - Canyon Prayer
Time after time, I've turned away from you,
When all I had to do was surrender to your love.
You've seen me stumble, you've watched me fall,
And though I heard you call, I just wasn't strong enough.
But there's an emptiness inside without you in my life:
Lord, I hope you hear my prayer tonight.
Won't you blind my eyes when all I see is temptation.
Break my stride when I'm runnin' from the truth.
An' tie my hands when I reach out with desire.
Go on an' do what you must do,
Whatever you must take me through till I turn to you.
Yeah.
I know that others fall down on their knees for mercy,
But you may have to hurt me before I see the light.
'Cause I've grown as far as I can go by myself:
I need your help if I'm gonna get it right.
Tired of strugglin' every day,
I wanna know the way,
So now the only prayer I wanna pray:
Is just blind my eyes when all I see is temptation.
Break my stride when I'm runnin' from the truth.
An' tie my hands when I reach out with desire.
Go on an' do what you must do,
Whatever you must put me through till I turn to you.
Yeah.
Blind my eyes;
Break my stride;
Whatever you want to be denied;
Whatever you must do.
An' tie my hands;
Ignore my demands;
Build a wall that stands so high, I can't get through,
Till I turn to you, yeah.
Until I turn to you.
'Cause I wanna turn to you,
Oh, yeah.
Oooh.
Oooh.
Jessi Alexander - Honeysuckle Sweet
Bare feet on southern soil
Burning up in the august heat
Tall grass and butterflies
Were all praying for breeze
I
m going down to the river
Gunna wade into my knees
Rest a while there on Herd Bank
Under cypress trees

There
s a back rout in my mind
Taking me back here every time
And it
s all mine it waits for me
If only in a daydream
Cause it
s long gone and it
s in my past
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be
Honeysuckle sweet
Honeysuckle sweet
In the evening on the back porch
You can see the stars like you've never seen
Patsy singing that sweet old song
I'm dancing on my daddy
s feet
Oh I was growing fast
I was restless as the wind
To young to know that once you leave
You
ll never be the same again

But there
s a back rout in my mind
Taking me back here every time
And it
s all mine it waits for me
If only in a daydream
Cause it
s long gone and it
s in my past
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be
Honeysuckle sweet
Honeysuckle sweet
I try to reach back in time
And touch those summer days
But as each year passes by
I feel them starting to fade
Oh there fading away yeah

But there
s a back rout in my mind
Taking me back there every time
And it
s all mine it waits for me
If only in a daydream
Cause it
s long gone and it
s in my past
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be
(Honeysuckle sweet)
Come on wind won't you take me home
I want to see how that grass has grown
Dirty water won't you wash me clean
(Honeysuckle sweet)
Ooo I smell it on the vine
I got to taste it one more time
(Honeysuckle Sweet)
Jimmy Buffett - Hey Good Looking
Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' something up with me?
Hey, hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe,
We could find us a brand new recipe.
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill,
An' I know a spot right over the hill.
There's soda pop and the dancin's free:
If you wanna have fun come along with me.
Hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?

An' find me one for five or ten cents.

Jimmy Buffett - Piece Of Work
I'm a piece of work, I'm iron and lace
I'm shy, I'm right up in your face
I'm all dumbfounded, stubborn as an ass
Sharp as an arrow in a pile of glass.
I'm a sweetheart, genius, reckless jerk.
Lord, have mercy, I'm a piece of work.
Well the Lord made me on a long thin limb
Made sure I'd remeber him or her
In the middle of a long dark night
Creation crazy, death-sheet white
Made in the image of a lion shocked lamb
I am who the hell I am
Even better, bad to worse,
Down to the letter, I'm a piece of work.
I'm a piece of work I'm an angels fiend
Bathed in lavender and gasoline
Scared brave, shallow in an ink black well
Lightly browned in the fires of hell
Wicked, holy, full on fake
Best known for my big mistake
I'm zen wise, peaceful, gone berserk
Good God almighty, What a piece of work.
I'm a dreadful sight, I just don't care
Spent all morning pull out my hair
Woke at dawn with a crazy spin
I was half the day trying to glue back in
Mother, bloody mary, please
Wipe that smile right off your knees
I'm the CEO of the mailroom clerks
Lord have mercy, I'm a piece of work.
I'm a piece of work, I'm a love sick boy
Cloth cap, caviar, and corduroy
All over the map, justa lost in space
With a filthy mind and a choirboy's face
Heels up, head down, straight on through
Watch out woman, I'm a get to you
I'm a gladiator with a mind to irk
I'm a see you later, I'm a piece of work.
Jimmy Buffett - Trip Around The Sun
(Jimmy Buffett):
Hear 'em singing 'Happy Birthday'
Better think about the wish I make
This year gone by
Ain't no piece of cake
(Martina McBride):
Every day's a revolution
Put 'em together and it comes undone
Just one more candle and
A trip around the sun
Chorus (Both):
I'm just hanging on while this old world keeps spinning
And it's good to know it's out of my control
If there's one thing that I've learned from all this living
It's that it wouldn't change a thing if I let go
(Martina McBride):
Though you never see it coming
Always wind up wondering where it went
(Jimmy Buffett):
Only time will tell
If it was time well spent
It's another revelation
(Martina McBride):
Celebrating what I should have done
With these souvenirs from my trip around the sun
Chorus (Both):
I'm just hanging on while this old world keeps spinning
And it's good to know it's out of my control
If there's one thing that I've learned from all this living
It's that it wouldn't change a thing if I let go
(Jimmy Buffett):
Yes, I'll make a resolution
(Martina McBride):
That I'll never make another one
(Both):
Just enjoy this ride on my trip around the sun
Just enjoy this ride on my trip around the sun
(Jimmy Buffett):
Just enjoy this ride until it's done
Jimmy Wayne - 
Jimmy Wayne - I Love You This Much
He can't remember the times that he thought
Does my daddy love me?
Probably not
But that didn't stop him from wishing that he did
Didn't keep from wanting or worshiping him
He guesses he saw him about once a year
He could still feel the way he felt
Standing in tears
Stretching his arms out as far as they'd go
Wispering daddy, I wan't you to know
Chorus
I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me to?
However long it takes
I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much
He grew to hate him for what he had done
'Cause what kind of a father, could do that to his son
He said 'damn you daddy', the day that he died
The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried
Chorus
Half way through the service
While the choir sand a hymn
He looked up above the preacher
And he sat and stared at him
He said
Forgive me father
When he realized
That he hadn't been unloved or alone all his life
His arms were stretched out as far as they'd go
Nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know
Chorus
Jimmy Wayne - Paper Angels
(verse)
Every day after Thanksgiving sell,
Malls just ain't complete,
Without a bunch of decorations and a paper angel tree,

There's artificial smiles on artificial tree limbs,
sayin what she'd love to have and what to buy for him,
()
Well I hope Maggie likes her new winter clothes,
And her buggie with a baby doll,
And maybe Thomas smile in his new Nike shoes,
When he shoots that basketball,

I can't help but wishin, that I could do more,
But not just while I'm shoping in the department store,

Paper angels you're in my thoughts and prayers,
No matter where you are right now,
Remember God's right there,
He's asking all of us,
To help take care of all his paper angels everywhere,
()
Goin through the mail on this stary afternoon,
I see a mom and dad's worse dream,
Their on the back of a money-savin-add,
To get my carpet clean,

Height, weight, hair, eyes, date missin, and D.O.B.
A child's picture and the words Have you see me,

Paper angels you're in my thoughts and prayers,
No matter where you are right now,
Remember God's right there,
He's asking all of us,
To help take care of all his paper angels everywhere

His documented bruises, film, a folder and a file,
She's a second grade self portrait drawn without a smile,
And every town has litter with this kind of debree,
We've got to stop this madness, it's up to you and me

Paper angels you're in my thoughts and prayers,
No matter where you are right now,
Remember God's right there,
He's asking all of us,
To help take care of all his paper angels everywhere,
Paper angels everywhere
Jimmy Wayne - You Are
Baby when I look at you,
You know it breaks my heart in two,
How beautiful you are

Seen you in a million dreams,

We will never be apart

You are my world, all of my dreams,
My fantasy, my reality,
I love everything you are, yes I do
()
Everytime I close my eyes,
Hit's me so deep inside,
How ill this feelin is,
I'm intoxicated by your touch,
It's a sweet sweet rush,
I'm in love with your kiss,

You're the one that I trust the most,
You changed me,

You are my love, you are my life,
My heart and soul the truest friend I've ever known,
You are my world, all of my dreams,
My fantasy, my reality,
I love everything you are,

You are my love, you are my life,
My heart and soul the truest friend I've ever known,
You are my world, all of my dreams,
My fantasy, my reality,
I love everything you are,
Everything, I love everything, you are
Jo Dee Messina - Delicious Surprise (I Believe It)
If I won me the lottery
I'd dance naked in the street
With a top hat full of money
And you'd wanna get to know me
If I won me the lottery
And if I was a movie star
I'd sip honey from a pickle jar
In the back of my limousine
They'd call me an icon
And I'd be lookin' back at you
From the cover of the people magazine
Bridge: I guess it's all for the takin'
I guess it's all yours and mine
My sister says I got to see it and believe it
Chorus: I believe it
I believe it
If I am just an outside
I'm livin' in a trailor with a black and white tv set
If only I was president, yah
You know I'd paint the white house pink
And never have to pay the rent
If only I was president
Bridge: I guess it's all there for the takin'
I think it's all yours and mine
My preacher says I've got to see it and believe it
Chorus:
I believe
I won't sleep 'til I've had enough
I believe
Won't sip my wine from no paper cup
I believe
Won't sleep 'til I've had enough
Until I've had enough
Delicious surprise
Now I do believe
Now it's there all the time
Inside I knew it all the time
Got me somethin' to believe in
But all I really want now is
A handful of salvation
(Repeat chorus 2x)
I believe
I won't sleep 'til I've had enough
I believe
Won't sip my wine from no paper cup
I believe
Won't sleep 'til I've had enough
Until I've had enough
Jo Dee Messina - I Wish
It's not easy saying this to you
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
But boy before you go
I want you to Know

I wish you strength
When times are hard
Oh I wish with all my heart you find just what
You're looking for
I wish you joy
I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me
I wish things were different you know that
But I'm still happy for the times we had
You mean the world to me
Baby Please Believe
[Repeat Chorus]
Losing you is tearing me apart
But a part of me will be with you
No matter where you are
[Repeat Chorus]
Jo Dee Messina - My Give A Damn's Busted
()
Well you filled up my head,
With so many lies.
Twisted my heart
Til something snapped inside.
I'd like to give it one more try
but my give a damn's busted.
You can crawl back home
say you were wrong,
stand out in the yard
cry all night long.
Well go ahead and water my lawn.
My give a damn's busted.

I really wanna care,
I wanna feel somethin'
Let me dig a little deeper...
Nope...
Sorry...
Nothin'
()
You can say you've got issues.
You can say you're a victim.
It's all your parents fault,
After all you didn't pick em
Well maybe Oprah's got time to listen.
My give a damn's busted.
(*Well let me get this straight now)
Your therapist said
It was all just a phase
A product of the prozac
And your co-dependent ways
So uhh ... who's your new neighbor these days
My give a damn's busted.

I really wanna care,
I wanna feel somethin'
Let me dig a little deeper...
Eeh-Eeh
(3rd verse)
(*Oh you're tellin' me)
It's a desperate situation,
No tellin' what you'll do.
If I don't forgive you,
You say your life is through.
Well honey... give me somethin' I can use.
(My give a damn's busted.)
(*Ahh you knew I was gonna say that, didn't ya.)
My give a damn's busted (*ha ha)
My give a damn's busted
Honey trust me
My give a damn's busted yeahhh ...
OOOH
My give a damn's busted yeahhh
(*You wanna do what?)(*ha ha ha ha ha)
My give a damn's busted
(*Get the party started thats what we'll do)
My give a damn's busted
(*I'm not done honey, trust me)
My give a damn's busted
(*Been there, done that)
My give a damn's busted
My give a damn's busted
Joe Diffie - Tougher Than Nails

Little boy walks in with a bloody nose,
Got beat up on his way home from school,
again,
His dad caught him running out the back,
Tears in his eyes and a baseball bat,
oo revenge,

Said son I won't stop ya
but before you go
Let me tell you a little story
bout the toughest man I know

You hit him
and he just turns the other cheek,
Don't think for a minute he was weak,
Cause in the end he showed them,
He was any-thing but frail,
They hammered him to a cross,
But he was tougher than nails,

Well he droped that bat
like it weighed a ton,
Father put his arms around his son
and said just let it go--oo,
Believe me I've been in your shoes,
Had to ask myself what would Jesus do,
here's what I know,

Whenever I'm in doubt
I look up what he said
It's all there in the good book
in black and whitnd red

Hit him and he just turns the other cheek,
Don't think for a minute he was weak,
Cause in the end he showed them,
He was any-thing but frail,
They hammered him to a cross,
But he was tougher than nails,
Yea in the end he showed them,
He was any-thing but frail,
They hammered him to a cross,
But he was tougher than nails,
Tougher than nails, oh, oh, oh,
Joe Nichols - Brokenheartsville
He wore that cowboy hat
To cover up his horns
Sweet talkin' forked tongue
Had a tempting charm
Before I turned around
That girl was gone
All I can say is
Bartender pour me something strong
chorus:
Here's to the past
They can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl
Who wrecked my world
That angel that did me in
I think the devil
Drives a Coup de Ville
I watched him drive away over the hill
Not against her will
And I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville
It was long and chrome
Sittin' in the lot
Fire engine red
That thing was hot
He revved it up
She waved goodbye
Love's gone to hell
And so have I
Chorus(2 times)
Joe Nichols - Cool To Be A Fool
Here I sit a nobody with no one
Bein' me ain't really all that fun
Leavin' her wasn't very smart
Admittin' I was wrong wouldn't be so hard
If it was cool to be a fool
I'd be the hippest guy around
If a heartache made you famous
I'd be known from town to town
If tears were made of pennies
And a cold beer brought her back
My bank account and self esteem
Would both be in the black
If some Hollywood producer made a movie that was sad
About some guy who lost the best thing he ever had
Hey, I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool
But we all know the way it really is
You don't get recognized for doin' things like this
You spend a lotta time feelin' sorry for yourself
It doesn't really mean that much to anybody else
If it was cool to be a fool
I'd be the hippest guy around
If a heartache made you famous
I'd be known from town to town
If tears were made of pennies
And a cold beer brought her back
My bank account and self esteem
Would both be in the black
If some Hollywood producer made a movie that was sad
About some guy who lost the best thing he ever had
Hey, I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool
Hey, I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool
Joe Nichols - If Nobody Believed In You
I watched him take the two strike call:
He hadn't tried to swing at all.
I guess he'd had all that he could take,
He walked away, for goodness sake.
His father's voice was loud an' mean:
You won't amount to anything.
That little boy quit tryin',
He just walked away.
There were teardrops on his face.
Tell me, how would you feel?
You'd probably give up too,
If nobody believed in you.
That old man said:
One more try
I know I'm not too old to drive,
I promise, son, I'll do my best,
This time, I'm gonna pass the test.
Give me the keys, Dad, an' get in.
His father never drove again.
That old man quit tryin',
He just turned away.
An' there were teardrops on his face.
Tell me, how would you feel?
You'd probably give up too,
If nobody believed in you.
We take His name out of schools.
The lawyers say it breaks the rules.
Pledge of allegiance can't be writ,
An' under God, should not be said.
I wonder how He will take.
I just pray it's not too late.
What if God quit tryin',
He just turned away?
There were teardrops on his face?
Tell me, how would you feel?
You'd probably give up too,
If nobody believed in you.
Tell me, how would you feel?
You'd probably give up too,
If nobody believed in you.
Joe Nichols - She Only Smokes When She Drinks
So you lit her cigarette
You're feelin' pretty good
You think you've got a shot
Most girls you probably would
Yeah this is that kind of place
But she ain't that kind of girl
You're readin' it all wrong
Let me tell you about her/
She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of bein' let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks
Did you ask her to dance
Let me guess, she told you no
Got to take her some place quiet
And see how far that goes
Oh, don't take it all that hard
When she smiles and turns you down
For a complicated girl
She ain't that hard to figure out
She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of bein' let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks
Joe Nichols - Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off
She said I
m going out with my girlfriends
Marguerite is at the holiday inn
Oh have mercy my only thought
Was tequila makes her clothes fall off
I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks patron?
Her closets missing half the things she bought
Yea tequila makes her clothes fall off
She
ll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink
Them panty hose aint gonna last too long
If the dj puts bon jovi on
She might come home in a table cloth
Yea tequila makes her clothes fall off
She can handle any champagne brunch
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jello shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off
She
ll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink
She don
t mean nothing
She just havin fun
Tomorrow she say oh what have I done
Her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
Yea tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh tequila makes her clothes fall off
Joe Nichols - What's a Guy Gotta Do
What's... a... guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Well ask anybody I'm a pretty good guy
And the looks decent wagon didn't pass me by
There ain't nothin in my past that I'm tryin hard to hide
And I don't understand why I gotta wonder why
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Cruise all around the right parking lots
little time gets killed alotta bull gets shot
one who'll think I'm kinda cute and laugh at every joke I got
when I get to thinkin maybe she's athinkin maybe not
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Had an old man tell me
Boy if you were smart
you'd hit the produce isle at the Super Walmart
So I bumped into a pretty girl's shopping cart
but all I did was break her eggs and bruise her artichoke hearts
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
John Michael Montgomery - Letters From Home
My Dear Son, it is almost June,
I hope this letter catches up to you, and finds you well.
Its been dry but they
re calling for rain,
And everything's the same ol
same in Johnsonville.
Your stubborn 'ol Daddy ain
t said too much,
But I
m sure you know he sends his love,
And she goes on,
In a letter from home.
I hold it up and show my buddies,
Like we ain
t scared and our boots ain
t muddy, and they all laugh,
Like there
s something funny bout
the way I talk,
When I say:
Mama sends her best y
all.
I fold it up an' put it in my shirt,
Pick up my gun an' get back to work.
An' it keeps me driving me on,
Waiting on letters from home.
My Dearest Love, its almost dawn.
I
ve been lying here all night long wondering where you might be.
I saw your Mama and I showed her the ring.
Man on the television said something so I couldn
t sleep.
But I
ll be all right, I
m just missing you.
An' this is me kissing you:
XX
s and OO
s,
In a letter from home.
I hold it up and show my buddies,
Like we ain
t scared and our boots ain
t muddy, and they all laugh,
'Cause she calls me
Honey
, but they take it hard,
'Cause I don
t read the good parts.
I fold it up an' put it in my shirt,
Pick up my gun an' get back to work.
An' it keeps me driving me on,
Waiting on letters from home.
Dear Son, I know I ain
t written,
But sittin' here tonight, alone in the kitchen, it occurs to me,
I might not have said, so I
ll say it now:
Son, you make me proud.
I hold it up and show my buddies,
Like we ain
t scared and our boots ain
t muddy, but no one laughs,
'Cause there ain
t nothing funny when a soldier cries.
An' I just wipe me eyes.
I fold it up an' put it in my shirt,
Pick up my gun an' get back to work.
An' it keeps me driving me on,
Waiting on letters from home.
John Michael Montgomery - Long As I Live
The world's been spinning 'round since time began
An' when it stops, it's out of my hands
So I could swear forever for all it's worth
Or give you every day I have on Earth
Long as I live
Long as I breathe
With every heartbeat
I'll need you near me
I won't leave you behind
'Til the Lord says it's time to go with him
I'm yours long as I live
No matter if there's mountains you can't move
Or harder times then you thought you'd go through
And the weight of your world's too much to bear
Just remember I'll always be there
Long as I live
Long as I breathe
With every heartbeat
I'll need you near me
I won't leave you behind
'Til the Lord says it's time to go with him
I'm yours long as I live
The moon and stars aren't mine to give
Neither is eternity
But I'll give you a promise tonight
That I can keep
Long as I live
Long as I breathe
With every heartbeat
I'll need you near me
I won't leave you behind
'Til the Lord says it's time to go with him
I'm yours long as I live
I'm yours long as I live
John Stone - Shame On Me
It's two a.m., and the 'phone begins to ring.
And if it's her, don't what I'm gonna do.
I'm scared like hell: don't what I'm gonna say.
But I guess I never did, anyway,
An' I thought she would always stay.
Shame on me, for takin' you for granted.
Shame on me, for all those times I wasn't there.
Shame on me, for never givin' you all you wanted, yeah, yeah.
An' acting like sometimes I don't care:
Shame on me.
Too many times, I put you behind.
An' couldn't see but girl, you opened up my eyes, yes you did.
Bein' alone ain't no place I wanna be.
And I know I should have held you,
All those times that you asked me to.
Shame on me for takin' you for granted.
Shame on me for all those times I wasn't there.
Shame on me for never givin' you all you wanted, yeah, yeah.
An' acting like sometimes I don't care:
Shame on me.
Shame on me for takin' you for granted.
Shame on me for all those times I wasn't there.
Shame on me for never givin' you all you wanted, yeah, yeah.
An' acting like sometimes I don't care:
Shame on me.
Girl, shame on me.
Oooh.
Josh Gracin - I Want To Live
(Josh Gracin was a finalist on American Idol)
Sometimes I feel like I need to shake myself, to wake myself:
I feel like I'm just sleep walkin' through out life.
It's like I'm swimmin' in an ocean of emotion,
But still, somehow, slowly goin' numb inside.
I don't like who I'm becomin', I know I've gotta do somethin',
Before my life passes right by.
I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,
An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.
Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',
Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.
Take everything that this world has to give:
I wanna live.
Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard to guard my heart.
Well, I hardly feel anything at all.
I've spent my whole life buildin' up this ivory tower.
Now that I'm in it, I keep wishin' it would fall.
So I can feel the ground beneath me, really taste this air I'm breathin',
And know that I'm alive.
I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,
An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.
Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',
Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.
Take everything that this world has to give:
I wanna live,
I wanna live.
Somethin' deep inside keeps sayin life is like a vapor:
It's gone in just the twinklin' of an eye.
I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,
An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.
Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',
Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.
Take everything that this world has to give.
I wanna take every breath I can get:
I wanna live.
Yeah, yeah

Josh Turner - Your Man
Baby lock the door and turn the light down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

Julie Roberts - Break Down Here
Mile marker 203, the gas guage leanin' on the edge of
E
,
An' I'll be dang'd if the rain ain't pourin' down.
There's somethin' smokin' underneath the hood,
It's a-bangin' and a-clangin' an' it can't be good,
An' it's another fifty miles to the nearest town.
Everythin' I own's in the back in a hefty bag;
I'm outta cigarettes an' I'm down to my last drag.
I'd sure hate to break down here,
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear view mirror.
Out in the middle of no-where, no-where.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
I'd sure hate to break down here.
Under fifty thousand miles ago,
Before the bad blood an' busted radio,
He said I was all he had ever needed.
But love is blind an' little did I know,
You were just another dead end road,
Made with pretty lies an' broken dreams.
Baby, leavin' you is easier than bein' gone.
I don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong.
I'd sure hate to break down here,
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear view mirror.
Out in the middle of no-where, no-where.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
An' I'd sure hate to break down here.
Oh, no.
I'd sure hate to break down here,
With nothin' up ahead or in the rear view mirror.
Out in the middle of no-where, no-where.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
An' I'd sure hate to break down,
It's too late to turn around.
I'd sure hate to break down here.
Kacey Musgraves - Merry Go 'round
If you ain't got two kids by 21,
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you.
And it don't matter if you don't believe,
Come Sunday morning you best be there
In the front row, like you're s'posed to.
Same hurt in every heart.
Same trailer, different park.
Mamas hooked on Mary Kay
Brothers hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddies hooked on Mary two doors down.
Mary Mary quite contrary,
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town.
On this broken merry go 'round and 'round and 'round we go,
Where it stops nobody knows...
And it ain't slowin' down, this merry go 'round...
We think the first time's good enough,
So we hold on to high school love,
Say we won't end up like our parents.
Tiny little boxes in a row,
Ain't want you want it's what you know,
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'.
Same checks we're always cashin',
To buy a little more distraction.
Cause Mamas hooked on Mary Kay
Brothers hooked on Mary Jane
Daddies hooked on Mary two doors down.
Mary Mary quite contrary,
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town.
On this broken merry go 'round and 'round and 'round we go,
Where we stop nobody knows...
And it ain't slowin' down, this merry go 'round...
Mary Mary quite contrary,
We're so bored until we're buried.
And just like dust we settle in this town.
On this broken merry go 'round...
Merry go 'round...
Jack and Jill went up the hill,
Jack burned out on booze and pills,
And Mary had a little lamb,
Mary just don't give a damn no more.
Katrina Elam - No End In Sight
There's a melody in my head,
An' I ain't stopped hummin' it since I saw your face.
There's a feelin' I can't forget,
It started with you kissin' me that way.
An' there's no end in sight.
Like an Oklahoma wheatfield growin',
You got my heart in motion: gone.
I'm the pinks an' you're the reds,
Just like the sunset; we belong.
An' there's no end in sight.
How high is the sky?
How long is time?
With you is how I'm spendin' mine.
Like there is no end in sight.
I wanna laugh, I wanna live.
I'm gonna love you like there is,
Like there is no end in sight.
So kick your shoes off, stay a while,
There's nothin' here but stars for miles, an' me.
We're standin' on the edge of somethin',
Not afraid of jumpin' in deep.
An' there's no end in sight.
How high is the sky?
How long is time?
With you is how I'm spendin' mine,
Like there is no end in sight.(Is no end, is no end in sight.)
I wanna laugh, I wanna live.
An' I'm gonna love you like there is,
Like there is no end in sight.(Is no end, is no end in sight.)
I'm gonna love you like there is,
Like there is no end in sight.(Is no end, is no end in sight.)
I'm gonna love you like there is no end in sight.
(I wanna laugh, I wanna live.
(An' I'm gonna love you like there is,
(There is no end, is no end, is no end in sight.)
There's a melody in my head,
An' I ain't stopped hummin' it since I saw your face.
Kay Adams - I Never Got to Nashville
Well, he told me I had what it takes,
And he told me all I needed was one lucky break.
Then he played me like he played his guitar,
And he said,
When you get to Nashville,
I'll make you a star.
Chorus:
But I never got to Nashville
He didn't make me a star.
No, I never got to Nashville,
I'm still playing in this bar.
But I'm going to keep on trying,
'Cause trying hard is what it takes.
Some day I'll be big in Nashville.
Someday I'll get that lucky break.
The jukebox plays his records, he's number one.
And now I know that I was just one night of fun.
Time goes by and Nashville seems so far away.
But, I know that I can make it, I'm on my way.
Chorus:
But I never got to Nashville
He didn't make me a star.
No, I never got to Nashville,
I'm still playing in this bar.
But I'm going to keep on trying,
'Cause trying hard is what it takes.
Some day I'll be big in Nashville.
Someday I'll get that lucky break.
Keith Anderson - Pickin' Wildflowers
Hey baby whatcha doin' this evening?
Can you meet me down at the railroad tracks?
I got Tom Petty playin' in my Silverado,
And I iced down a six-pack.
Hey Daisy don't you worry 'bout your mama,
Like 007 we can keep it covert.
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace... on earth.
Chorus:
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods.
Sneak away for a couple of hours,
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers.
Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin'
And love's bloomin' like a cherry tree.
Let's buzz around, maybe do some pollenating,
Dive on in like honey bees.
Chorus:
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods.
Sneak away for a couple of hours,
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers.
Take a trail ride if you know what I mean.
Hey baby won't you come with me?
Chorus:
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods.
Sneak away for a couple of hours,
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers.
Chorus:
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods.
Sneak away for a couple of hours,
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers.
Keith Anderson - XXL
Well, Mamma was exhausted after she had me.
Took two nurses to hold me an' one nurse to slap me.
Doctor turned Mamma an' he shook his head,
Wiped the sweat off his brow an' then he said:
This boy's way off the charts as far as I can tell.
Ooh, brrr, Mamma: he's a double XL.
By the second grade, I was five foot two;
Fifth grade, I was wearin' a size 12 shoe.
Eighth grade, I was shoppin' at the Big
Tall,
An' the coaches had me playin' High School football.
Uncle Roy said:
Boy, you'll make the NFL:
Ooh, brrr, son you're a double XL.
Double XL, double XL.
Don't call me on the 'phone, just ring my dinner bell.
Double XL, double XL.
I'm a lean mean love machine that likes to be held.
Ooh, brrr, baby: I'm a double XL.
Here we go.
Country cuties in Texas, string bikinis in Florida;
Barbie dolls drivin' Lexus' out in California:
A skinny little pretty boy ain't what they wanna hold.
They want a real man with meat on his bones.
I'll yank their yankees, ring their southern bells:
They say:
Ooh, brrr, we love a double XL.
Double XL, double XL.
Don't call me on the 'phone, just ring my dinner bell.
Double XL, double XL.
I'm a lean mean love machine that likes to be held.
Ooh, brrr, baby: I'm a double XL.
Instrumental Break.
(Double XL solo.)
Well, double XL, double XL.
Don't call me on the 'phone, just ring my dinner bell.
Double XL, double XL.
I'm a lean mean love machine that likes to be held.
Ooh, brrr, baby: I'm a double XL.
Well if you have any doubts, come see for yourself,
Why all the girls love a double XL.
Ooh, brrr, yeah: I'm a double XL.
Yeah, oh whoa.
Triple X-L, too.
Keith Urban - Better Life
Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide-awake just watchin' you sleep
And I promise you you're gonna have
More than just the things that you need
We ain't got much now, We're just startin' out
But I know somehow paradise is comin'

Someday baby, You and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
Oh now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're gonna fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters

Someday baby, You and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
So hold on, hold on
C'mon baby, hold on

We're gonna be the ones that have it all, you and me
Just hold on tight now baby
Keith Urban - Days Go By
Changin' lanes and talkin' on the phone
Drivin' way too fast
The interstate's jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of comin' in last
But somewhere in the race we run
We're comin' undone
Days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window in the wind
Cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So we better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by
I was on the roof just the other night
And watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights and runnin' through the river
Of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
We're losin' ourselves

We think about tomorrow, then it slips away
We talk about forever but we've only got today
Days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window as the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So we'd better start livin'
We'd better start livin'
We'd better start livin' right now

'Cause days go by
So take them by the hand
And in your mind
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by your hand
Don't let your life fly by
Come on
Come on now
Don't you know the days go by
Keith Urban - Making Memories Of Us
I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I wanna sleep with you forever
And I wanna die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm
And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
I wanna honor your mother
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been
And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Comin' your way
I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits but it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you with a warm, wet kiss
And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll win your trust making memories of us
Keith Urban - Tonight I Wanna Cry
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walkin' away
Chorus:
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
All By Myself
would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way
Chorus:
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
Chorus:
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
Keith Urban - You (Or Somebody Like You)
Outside my window, I swear on my mothers grave,
Faded out the street noise like a, out of focus polaroid,
So we shot the moon, and I cursed the wind,
Making me think that you were, here again,
Smoke and mirrors, somebody stole you away,
Thats the biggest conspiracy since, JFK,
So we combed the corners, and glass houses,
We got directions, but, never found it.
Well I'd trade in all the rest of my days,
Just the mere reflection of your face,
For one shining moment...

With you, somebody like you,
With you, somebody just like you,
We called inspectors, the cops and the CIA,
The drooch truck circles round, the places that we used to lay,
But nobody testified, not a single witness,
Swore i was crucified and, no forgiveness,
The sherriff sounded a lot like I was drunk and dangerous,
My hands were already tied, so he , put away his handcuffs,
And in the blindspot, I saw the silhouette,
Of a crazy man smoking , long black cigarette,
But I'd trade in all the rest of my days,
Your crooked smile, your wicked ways,
I'd fill up all this centre space,

With you, somebody like you,
With you, somebody just like you,
Oh you, somebody like you.. oh
Now I shoulda learned my lesson,
Done what I was told,
Shoulda counted all my blessings,
And my fingers and toes,
And now I'm, tripping like a blind man,
And searching high and low,
For you, somebody like you
For you, somebody just like you...
For you, somebody like you,
For you somebody just like you
Yeah... yeah somebody just like you
Somebody just like you...
Keith Urban - You'll Think Of Me
I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some 
                      sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah
And you're gonna think of me
Oh someday baby, someday
Keith Urban - You're My Better Half
Car door slams, it's been a long day at work
I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all gonna be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close and you hold me tight

It's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
'Cause when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you 'cause baby
You're my better half
They say behind every man is a good woman
But I think that's a lie
'Cause when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side
You don't know how much I count you to help me
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all gonna be alright
You take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and you me tight

It's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
'Cause when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you 'cause baby
You're my better half
Well, you take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and I understand
It's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe that we can make it through anything
Oh baby, it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
'Cause when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you 'cause baby
You're my better half
Oh, oh baby you're my better half
Ooh, hey baby you're my better half
Keni Thomas - Not Me
No one raised their hand that day when they asked for volunteers.
He got picked out by default he was the only daddy there.
They said we know what you're thinking
Choose someone else instead but this league is built on coaches
who stood right there and said...
Not Me not me no way with this job of mine i could never find the time not me not me
The world becomes a better place when
someone stands and leads the way steps forward when they'd rather say not me
The judge says you're the oldest may choose a legal guardian
I'm sorry that you lost your folks but theres no next of kin
Two brothers and a sister she knew how hard it would be but she softly said
I'll raise them while a voice inside her screamed....
Not me Not me I can't believe what's happening
This isn't how it's supposed to be Not me not me
The world becomes a better place when someone stands
and leads the way steps forward when they'd rather say not me
A young captain at attention, a star pin on his chest
He recalls the battle while the final roll call's read
They were the finest soldiers it was my priviledge to lead
They deserve the medals the men who died not me
Not me not me I just did what i was called to do you'd do the same if it was you
Not me not me
The world becomes a better place when someone stands
and leads the way steps forward when they'd rather say not me
Yeah steps forward when they'd rather say Not me
Not me
Not me

All I want for christmas is a real good tan..
All I want for christmas is a real good tan..

Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile, he n Mary making her way into the

her hands said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet
And in the morning I

on my neck in the mist of the music I tell her I love her, we both laugh cause it isn

Kenny Chesney - Be As You Are
Never gonna look back
Once my feet hit the sand
I've had it up to here with this rat race
Need a smile on my face
I wanna go where I can lighten up the load
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
Get this laying low off to a flying start
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star
And be as you are
Gettin' stuck sure would be easy
In this palm tree paradise
Ambition fades with every wave
For the finer things in life
Maybe I'll just hang around here
Go home later next year
I wanna go where I can lighten up the load
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
Get this laying low off to a flying start
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star
And be as you are
I wanna play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star
And be as you are

Kenny Chesney - Boston
Where the ferries come to shore
She never really knew how good it would feel
To finally find herself in a place so warm and real
She wears a Red Sox cap
To hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England
Is different now and dead
In all the local bars
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'
She's from Boston
She comes from Boston
Talks to her family now and then
Through e-mails and postcards
She tries to explain to them
That education and occupation will have to wait for now
She loves the Rasta, reggae rhythms, her dreams have changed somehow
She wears a Red Sox cap
To hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England
Is different now and dead
In all the local bars
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'
She's from Boston
Her toes dig deep and deeper in the sand
She's seduced by the sunsets and her new life at hand
She wears a Red Sox cap
To hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England
Is different now and dead
In all the local bars
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'
She's from Boston
She wears a Red Sox cap
To hide her baby dreads
From Boston
Kenny Chesney - French Kissing Life
And any minute she's gonna blow
I need a shave and I need some rest
I know some people are worried about me
But I'm french kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea
Went through customs and immigration
Still this feels like home
I'm floating 'round through Gorda Sound
With a cooler and a bong
Maybe I could've been a pirate
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea
Tonight I don't need to feel famous
Out here all I feel is free
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea
Maybe I could've been a pirate
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be
French kissing life square in the mouth
Kenny Chesney - Guitars And Tiki Bars
We all get sick of it all now and then
When I've had it up to here
I go down there
To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
I feel like a fish jerked out of the sea
Or a bird in a cage that's never seen a key
Sick of this grind and I think that I ought
To bring this grind to a grinding halt
Now I've had it up to here
Let's go down there
To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Now I've had it up to here
Let's go down there
To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
Kenny Chesney - I Go Back
Jack and Diane
painted a picture of my life and my dreams,
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause everytime I hear that song...
I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Drivin my first love out to the levvy
Livin life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I used to rock all night to
Keep On Rockin Me Baby
Frat parties, college bars, just tryin to impress the ladies
I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause everytime I hear that song....
I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on the Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back, I go back
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time
So I go back to a pew,preacher, and a choir
Singin bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now
Only The Good Die Young
stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back....
Kenny Chesney - Island Boy
So he saved his money, sold his car
And with his eye set on a Southern star
Got the courage to follow his heart
Set out for a brand new start
He's an island boy
Now he's an island boy
Living his life where stress is the enemy
Now he's an island boy
A stone's throw from St. Croix
He's finally found his piece of serenity
Now he tends bar at the Old Mango
And he sees tourists come and go
With their pressed pants and camera case
Too much sun burned on their face
Now he watches the snow on CNN
With all of his dope-smokin' friends
Just look at the hell they must be in
Swears he won't go back again
He's an island boy
Now he's an island boy
Living his life where stress is the enemy
Now he's an island boy
A stone's throw from St. Croix
He's finally found his piece of serenity
You know the love of his life has always been Emily
She loves the man she sees
In her island boy
Now he's an island boy
Living his life where stress is the enemy
Now he's an island boy
A stone's throw from St. Croix
He's finally found his piece of serenity
Island boy
A stone's throw from St. Croix
Island boy
Island boy
Kenny Chesney - Keg In The Closet
We had a dog named Bocephus? living in the front yard he liked sleeping out on the top of
the car he
d drink beer out of the mason jar and he climb up on everyone bed
A white frame house, a college town, a bunch of people always hanging around, no real
problems we need to drown but we tried our best anyway, we went to class just to pass the time
back in eighty nine

We had a Keg in the closet pizza on the floor left over from the night before where
we were going we didn
t really care we had all we ever wanted in that keg in the closet
This old guitar taught me how to score right there on the Lambda Chi porch, Mary Ann taught
me a little more one what you cant have, sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in
panama, for a while we had it all we never dreamed it wouldn
t last, we went to class just to
pass the time back in eighty nine

We had a Keg in the closet pizza on the floor left over from the night before where
we were going we didn
t really care we had all we ever wanted in that keg in the closet
We all kind of went our separate ways, but I swear it seems like yesterday

We had a Keg in the closet pizza on the floor left over from the night before where
we were going we didn
t really care we had all we ever wanted in that keg in the closet
Kenny Chesney - Key Lime Pie
Ocean breeze, tire swing
Coconut fall if you shake that thing
And my, my, my - my key lime pie
Not too tart, not too sweet
My baby loves to watch me eat
Her key lime pie
Her key lime pie
Tall green tree, yellow bird
Bikini bottom and a tie-dyed shirt
And my, my, my - my key lime pie
Big white sail, red sunset
Lobster tail and don't forget
My, my, my - my key lime pie
A six string, ten shots
Of Cruzan rum, hey, I like it a lot
With my, my, my - my key lime pie
Tortola, a full moon
Shining down on a blue lagoon
And my, my, my - my key lime pie
Not too tart, not too sweet
My baby loves to watch me eat
Her key lime pie
Her key lime pie
We got Ginger and Mary Ann
Cookin' up a real good tan
And my, my, my - my key lime pie
Key lime pie, key lime pie
Key lime pie, my my my
My, my, my key lime pie
Key lime pie, key lime pie
Kenny Chesney - Live Those Songs
Saw him sittin on a sidewalk in Fresno
Braided hair and a tye-dyed t-shirt on
Talkin to himself about Vietnam
About the tour he did and the deal he got
He said this world ain't the same if you ask me.
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be
I'd be rollin' on a river with Credence
Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a Panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll in
He said what I wouldn't give just to live those songs again.
Saw him workin' the counter at Walgreens
With a new haircut and a Bachelor's Degree
Talkin' to himself about his raw deal
Cussin' Uncle Sam and the GI bill
He said This world ain't the same if you ask me
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be
I'd be rollin' on a river with Credence
Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a Panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll in
He said what I wouldn't give just to live those songs again.

Kenny Chesney - Magic
I believe there is magic here
It's in buried treasure under the sea
In the music that drifts out on the street
It's in the barflies drinking their beer
I believe there's magic here
This crazy rock has got a lot
Of romance and sex appeal
It's lazy days with Hemingway
And I gotta say that it captures me still
'Cause I believe there's magic in those beachside dives
Under the moon as it's changing the tides
Friends they go away, then they reappear
I believe there is magic here
This crazy rock has got a lot
Of romance and sex appeal
It's lazy days with Hemingway
And I gotta say that it captures me still
'Cause I believe there's magic in those beachside dives
Under the moon as it's changing the tides
Friends they go away, then they reappear
I believe there is magic here
Friends they go away, then they reappear
I believe there is magic
A whole lotta magic
I believe there is magic here
I believe there is magic
A whole lotta magic
Kenny Chesney - Me And You
Ordinary no, really don't think so
Not a love this true
Common destiny
We were meant to be
Me and you
Like a perfect scene from a movie screen
Where every dream comes true
Suited perfectly for eternity
Me and you
Every day, I need you even more
At the nighttime too
There's no way
I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Every day I live
I try my best to give
All I have to you
I thank the stars above
That we share this love Me and you
Every day, I need you even more
At the nighttime too
There's no way
I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Ordinary no, I really don't think so
Just a precious few
Ever make it last
Get as lucky as
Me and you
Me and you
Kenny Chesney - Old Blue Chair
There's a blue rocking chair
Sittin' in the sand
Weathered by the storms
And well oiled hands
It sways back and forth
With the help of the winds
It seems to always be there
Like an old trusted friend
I've read a lot of books
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life
Where it's going, where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield
But nothing compares
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it
When I sit in that old blue chair
From that chair I've caught
A few fish and some rays
And I've watched boats sail
In and out of Cinnamon Bay
I let go of a lover
That took a piece of my heart
And prayed many times for forgiveness
And a brand new start
I've read a lot of books
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life
Where it's going, where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield
But nothing compares
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it
When I sit in that old blue chair
That chair was my bed one New Year's night
When I passed out from too much Malibu
And I woke up to a hundred mosquito bites, I swear
Got 'em all sitting right there
In that old blue chair
There's a blue rocking chair
Sittin' in the sand
Weathered by the storms
And well oiled hands.
Kenny Chesney - Outta Here
Lets leave town on a permanent vacation
Lock up the house pack up the station wagon
Make paradise our final destination
As long as we're outta here
There ain't no time like the present they say
Lets cruise all the way down A1A
Put the top down and catch a few rays
Baby we'll be outta here

Anywhere you want to go
As long as its sunny weather
Let the time fly by I don't mind
As long as we're together
South of the border there's a place I know
Where James Taylor sang about Mexica
And the suns so hot we'll forget to go home
Baby we'll be outta here

Anywhere you want to go
As long as its sunny weather
Let the time fly by I don't mind
As long as we're together
Maybe drive to the country
Down to the lake see if the catfish are jumpin set our bait
And if we come up dry we'll just sleep in late
At least we'll be outta here
As long as we're outta here
Baby lets get outta here
Outta here
-Talking-
Come on baby lets get outta here
Cruise down A1A
Go hang out in Key West for awhile
Kenny Chesney - Please Come to Boston
Please come to Boston
For the springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends
And they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe where I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston
She said no, boy you come home to me
Chorus:
(And) She said, hey ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down
(Boston, Denver, L.A.) ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold
And there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan
Of the band from Tennessee
Please come to Denver
To see the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains
So far we can't be found
And throw I love you echos
Down the canyons
And then lie awake at night
Until they come back around
Please come to Denver
She said no boy you come home to me
Repeat Chorus:
Now that drifter's world
Goes round and round
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams
He's lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I need somebody I can cling to
Somebody he can sing to
He said please come to L.A.
To live forever
A California life alone
Is just too hard to build
I live in a house that
Looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars
That fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill
Please come to L.A.
I just said no
Boy, you come home to me
Repeat Chorus
I'm the number one fan
of the band from Tennessee
Tennessee
Kenny Chesney - Sherry's Living In Paradise
Southern California could not hold her dreams
She's happy now it seems
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise
Chasing something or running from something
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing
And she's thought about leaving once or twice
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life
Sherry's living in paradise
Sherry's living in paradise
Somehow the salty air, it soothes her soul
Says it makes her whole
She gets hit on by the tourists
But she brushes it off 'cause she's heard every line
She just takes it in stride
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise
Chasing something or running from something
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing
And she's thought about leaving once or twice
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life
Sherry's living in paradise
She's thought about leaving once or twice
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life
Kenny Chesney - Some People Change
His old man was a rebel yeller, that boy to the bone, and say can

Kenny Chesney - Somewhere In the Sun
Makes me long for where I really want to be
Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum
Or kickin' back with Ivan
With all my friends down in the islands
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run
To another life somewhere in the sun
Got cold fajitas and only one channel on the TV
Andy and Barney on Nick at Nite
Seen an ad for Mexico, God I really want to go
Anywhere out of mind and out of sight
Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum
Or kickin' back with Ivan
With all my friends down in the islands
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run
To another life somewhere in the sun
Here's a toast to you on the coast and the sailors out at sea
Drink your ales, hoist your sails
Ride the winds and think of me, 'cause
Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum
Or kickin' back with Ivan
With all my friends down in the islands
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run
To another life somewhere in the sun
Kenny Chesney - Soul of a Sailor
I was born a son of the sea
I can't be still, I can't be tied
The only time I feel alive is
When the wind fills my sail
Riding on a lifelong swell
Let my heart take me where it wants to go
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor
He slid a stool and a beer to me
Said, you know, we're both a dying breed
Here's to love lost and newfound friends
And living out life in the boat we're in
I can't be still, I can't be tied
The only time I feel alive is
When the wind fills my sail
Riding on a lifelong swell
Let my heart take me where it wants to go
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor
Let my heart take me where it wants to go
Kenny Chesney - The Woman With You
She hit the door 6:55 sack full of groceries split down the side.
Can goods scattered all the way to the curb.
Look on her face saying don't say a word.
So, it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing.
Western sky all turning red.
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said:
Been gopherin, chaufferin, company chairmen.
Coffee maker, Copy repairman.
Anymore there ain't nothin I swear man that I don't do.
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals.
Dancing backwards in high heels.
Just when it feels like i can't make it through.
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you
She said the girl I was with the business degree probally wouldn't recognize me.
I was going around the bank.
I was going to run them out.
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath.
Back then you know I had this plan.
Before all of this reality set in.
Here comes life boy ready or not.
Hey I wanted it all and thats what I got.
Cause I'm gopherin, chaufferin, company chairmen.
Coffee maker, Copy repairman.
Anymore there ain't nothin I swear man that
I don't do.
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals.
Dancing backwards in high heels.
Just when it feels like I can't make it through.
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you.
She said I'm gopherin,chaufferin, company chairmen.
Coffee maker, Copy repairman.
Anymore there ain't nothin I swear man that I don't do.
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals.
Dancing backwards in high heels.
Just when it feels like I can't make it through.
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman the woman with you.
La, la, la, la, la, la
The woman with you
Kenny Chesney - There Goes My Life
All he could think about was:
I'm too young for this.
Got my whole life ahead.
Hell, I'm just a kid myself:
How 'm I gonna raise one?
All he could see were his dreams,
Going up in smoke.
So much for ditchin' this town,
An' hangin' out on the coast.
Oh well, those plans are long gone.
And he said:
There goes my life.
There goes my future, my everything.
Might as well kiss it all good-bye:
There goes my life.
A couple years of up all night,
An' a few thousand diapers later.
That mistake he thought he made,
Covers up the refrigerator:
Oh yeah, he loves that little girl.
An' Momma's waiting to tuck her in,
As she fumbles up those stairs.
She smiles back at him,
Dragging that teddy bear:
Sleep tight.
Blue eyes and bouncing curls.
An' he smiles:
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything.
I love you, Daddy, goodnight.
There goes my life.
She had that Honda loaded down,
With Abercrombie clothes,
An' and fifteen pairs of shoes,
An' his American Express.
He checked the oil and slammed the hood,
Said:
You're good to go.
She hugged them both,
An'd headed off to the west coast.
An' he cried:
There goes my life.
There goes my future, my everything.
I love you, baby, good-bye.
There goes my life.
There goes my life.
Baby, good-bye.
Fades.
Kenny Chesney - There's Something Sexy About The Rain
She spread her arms and spun around
In a summer island storm
In a field of sugarcane
She taught me how and showed me why
There's something sexy about the rain
And sometimes it rained all night
And everything she did was perfect
And every way we were was right
We loved like there was no tomorrow
Then suddenly tomorrow came
And it was raining at the airport
And kept on raining on the plane
She only loved me for a season
But my heart won't ever be the same
Even now her love's the reason
There's something sexy about the rain
And sometimes when it's pouring down
I feel her kisses on my skin
I spread my arms and spin around
And let that summer island storm
Hit me like a hurricane
It's like she's right here whispering
There's something sexy about the rain
She followed me back to the city
In a picture in my mind
She's still young and she's still pretty
And even after all this time
There's something sexy about the rain
She said as it came pouring down
It feels like kisses on my skin
She spread her arms and spun around
In a summer island storm
In a field, in a field of sugarcane
She taught me how and showed me why
There's something sexy about the rain
She taught me how and she's still why
There's something sexy about the rain
Something sexy about the rain
Feels like kisses on my skin
In a summer island storm
Kenny Chesney - What I Need To Do
I keep tellin myself this is the right thing to do
I was wastin her time, waitin on dreams that just weren't comin true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leadin me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doin all that I can to get my mind off us
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on
Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's goin down on my broken heart
Lord, I gotta go bak before I get too far
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on
But I drive on
Yes I drive on, and on, and on
Knowin what I need to do
Girl, I'm comin home to you
Knowin what I need to do
Girl I'm comin home to you
I'm comin home to you
Knowin what I need to do...
Kenny Chesney - When I Think About Leaving
You know some times me and my lady have these crazy fights and when we do it makes me wonder
Are we're ever gonna get it right
When I think about leaving I think about me
What my life would be like if I were back to being free
Go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do, wouldn't have a soul I had to answer to
When I think about leaving I think about me
You know I got a friend him and his wife just couldn't see eye to eye he had all he could
Stand one day and just packed up and said good-bye
When I think about leaving I think about him
That little apartment cross town he's living in
Got an old corvette, got a new girlfriend, but only sees his kids every other weekend
When I think about leaving oh I think about him
I never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad, how he walked out on her
And her mom when she was just a kid
When I think about leaving oh I think about her
Only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt
With her little arms wrapped around his neck saying daddy where you going, are you coming
Back
When I think about leaving I think about her
You know the truth is, most of the time things were really great and I know we got something
Special
When I think about leaving I think about us
How we build this love we share on faith and trust, honest way we talk, tender way we touch,
All those nights we spent making love,
When I think about leaving oh I think about us
When I think about leaving I think again
Even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then
In my heart I know I would never leave, there's nowhere else on earth I would rather be
When I think about leaving I think again
When I think about leaving
When I think about leaving
When I think about leaving:I think again
Kenny Chesney - When The Sun Goes Down
Sun tanned toes ticklin the sand
Cold drink chillin in my right hand
Watchin you sleep in the evening light
Restin up for a long, long night
Chorus:
Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
All day long just takin it easy
Layin in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleepin off the night before
Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more
Chorus:
When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
This sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to do but breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play
Repeat chorus
Kenny Chesney - Who You'd Be Today
Sunny days seem to hurt the most
Wear the pain like a heavy coat
I feel you everywhere I go
See your smile, I see your face
I hear you laughing in the rain
Still can't believe your gone

It ain't fair you died to young
Like a story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing, no one could take your place
Sometimes I wonder, who you'd be today
Would you see the world
Would you chase your dreams
Settle down with a family
I wonder what would you name your babies
Someday's the sky's so blue
I feel like I can talk to you
And I know it might sound crazy

Today 
Today 
Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
The only thing that gives me hope
Is I know, I'll see you again someday
Someday, someday
Kenny Rogers - My World Is Over
(feat. Whitney Duncan)
I didn't look over my shoulder
I wasn't ready for this
Didn't see the signs over the horizon
I was so sure that you would never leave
But you did
So sweep away the sand, and tide, the ocean, and just
Pack the moon and stars up in a cardboard box, and
Stop the clouds from chimin'
Block the sun from shinin'
Paint the sky a deeper shade of blue
?Cause my world's over without you
I know I should just keep goin'
But I don't know where to start
I never thought I'd see the day when
You'd go and leave me here with my broken heart,
But you did
CHORUS
Maybe someday all the pain will fade
Maybe this hurt will slowly slip away
Maybe some days will never change
And I'll still love you
Stop the clouds from chimin'
Block the sun from shinin'
Paint the sky a deeper shade of blue
?Cause my world's over without you
My world's over without you..
Stop the clouds from chimin'
Stop the clouds from chimin'
Block the sun from shinin'
Block the sun from shinin'

Kevin Fowler - Don't Touch My Willie
She showed up at my house at half past nine
In a low-cut dress with a bottle of wine
She said this will be a night you won't forget
She poured us some drinks to get us into the mood
I reached for the lights, she reached for my tunes
She pulled out that Red Headed Stranger, I stood up and said
Don't touch my Willie
I don't know you that well
Help yourself to some Haggard or some Jones
Hell, or anybody else
I don't know what you heard
I ain't that kind of guy
Yeah so don't touch my Willie,
We'll get a long just fine
She said she never met a man like me in her life
Who wouldn't share his Willie on the very first night
I said it's nothing personal, don't take it so hard
I don't pull out my Willie for just anyone
There's a lot of other records that you can choose from
So let me make myself clear before you go too far
Don't touch my Willie
I don't know you that well
Help yourself to some Haggard or some Jones
Hell, or anybody else
I don't know what you heard
I ain't that kind of guy
Yeah so don't touch my Willie,
We'll get a long just fine
Keep your hands off my Willie,
We'll get along just fine
LeAnn Rimes - Probably Wouldn't Be This Way
Got a date a week from Friday with the Preacher's son,
Everybody says he's crazy, I'll have to see
I finally moved to Jackson when the summer came,
I won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves
I'm probably going on and on it seems I'm doing more of that these days

I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it,
Oh you left so fast,
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
God give me moments grace
Cause if I'd nevber seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way
Momma says that I just shouldn't speak to you,
Susan says that I should just move on,
You oughta see the way these people look at me,
When they see me 'round here talking to this stone,
Everybody thinks I've lost my mind but I just take it day by day

I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it,
Oh you left so fast,
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
God give me moments grace
Cause if I'd nevber seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't be this way,
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad,
I never pictured every minute without you in it,
Oh you left so fast,
Sometimes I see you standing there,
Sometimes I feel an angels touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
God give me a moments grace
Cause if I'd never see your face
I probably woudln't be this way
I probably wouldn't be this way
Got a date a week from a Friday with the Preacher's son,
Everybody says I'm crazy, guess I'll have to see
Lee Ann Womack - (Now You See Me) Now You Don't
Better take a good look before I disappear
Because I'm just about to be your used-to-be
You might catch a glimpse of my taillights in the dust
And if you notice something missin', well it's me
'Cause I tried and you lied
I cried and you stood by
Well, here's a little magic thing I do
Now you see me, now you don't
First you do but then you won't
Watch me vanish right before your eyes
You might think you see me there
In a cafe on a street somewhere
Yeah, that might be me but I'll be gone
Now you see me, now you don't
If you ever get the feelin' that it feels like deja vu
Because some stranger feels like someone that you know
Might be the color of her lipstick or the smell of her perfume
That sends a shiver all the way down to your toes
Don't blink 'cause it ain't yeah what you think
It's just your heart playing tricks on you
Now you see me, now you don't
First you do but then you won't
Watch me vanish right before your eyes
You might think you see me there
In a cafe on a street somewhere
Yeah, that might be me but I'll be gone
Now you see me, now you don't
You might think you see me there
In a cafe on a street somewhere
Yeah, that might be me, but I'll be gone
Now you see me, now you don't
Now you see me, now you don't
Now you see me, now you don't
Now you see me
Lee Ann Womack - A Little Past Little Rock
I had to leave my life in Dallas
That town will always be you
In every crowd, on every corner
In every face I'd see you
So with nothin' more than a tank of gas
I drove away without lookin' back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
And goin' anywhere as fast as I can
And I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I gotta keep my heart out of this and both hands on the wheel
I'm learnin' more with every mile just how leavin' feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you
These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have my way
I'd go back to where you are
Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
Oh, and I'm still a far cry from gone
And I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I gotta keep my heart out of this and both hands on the wheel
I'm learnin' more with every mile just how leavin' feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you
Lee Ann Womack - Ashes By Now
This morning is Monday, where are you now
Teasing my memory, teaching me how to lay low
When I don’t want to
Your love is elusive, this I know now
It’s makin’ me crazy, leaving me out in the open
When I don’t want to
Baby, I can’t go through this again
I don’t need to go down, more than I’ve already been
Just like a wildfire, you’re running all over town
As much as you burn me baby
I should be ashes by now
The moments of pleasure just never do last
They’re gone like a suitcase full of your past
Long gone and in a hurry
Baby, I can’t go through this again
I don’t need to go down, more than I’ve already been
Just like a wildfire, you’re running all over town
As much as you burn me baby
I should be ashes by now
Lee Ann Womack - Does My Ring Burn Your Finger
When I gave you my heart
It was not what you wanted
Now the walls say your name
And the pictures are haunted
Does my ring burn your finger
Did my love weigh you down
Was a promise to much
To keep around
I remember your words
And I can’t keep from crying
I could never believe
That your kisses were lying
Was there something from the past
Buried in a shallow grave
Did you thing that it was too far gone to save
Please tell me baby
Please tell me now
You say that I should just go on
Now please tell me how
Now it’s just me and the night
And I’m so broken hearted
I just wait in the dark here
For my dearly departed
Does my ring burn your finger
Did my love weigh you down
Was a promise to much
To keep around
Lee Ann Womack - He Oughta Know That By Now
I guess he's working late again
I don't need to wonder where he is
But I do
He oughta know that by now
I know his work takes a lot of him
There's not much left for him to give
But I need more
He oughta know that by now
It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
It's just too hard to hold on to what's never around
He oughta know that by now
He used to promise soon things would change
It's been years and it's still the same
And that hurts
He oughta know that by now
I've grown so used to being alone
Couldn't be much worse if I were gone
And in a way I am
He oughta know that by now
It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
It's just too hard to hold on to what is never around
He oughta know that by now
Heart ache and coffee at midnight motels
Leaving him was hard as hell
But I did
And he oughta know that by now
I didn't try to explain
No goodbye underneath my ring
That was all I left
He oughta know that by now
That was all I left
And he oughta know that by now
Lee Ann Womack - I Hope You Dance
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small
When you stand by the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me you'll give fate a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Lovin' might be a mistake
But it's worth making
Don't let some hell bent heart
Leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above
More than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always)
I hope you dance
(Rolling us along)
I hope you dance
(Tell me who)
I hope you dance
(Wants to look back on their years and wonder)
(Where those years have gone)
I hope you still feel small
When you stand by the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always)
I hope you dance
(Rolling us along)
I hope you dance
(Tell me who)
(Wants to look back on their years and wonder)
I hope you dance
(Where those years have gone)
(Tell me who)
I hope you dance
(Wants to look back on their years and wonder)
(Where those years have gone)
Lee Ann Womack - I May Hate Myself In The Morning
Ain't it just like one of us to pick up the phone and call after a couple of drinks
And say
How've you been
and wonderin' that maybe you've been thinkin' 'bout me
And somewhere in the conversation an old familiar invitation always arrives
And I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight.
Everyone's known someone that they just can't help but want
And even though they just can't make it work out, well the ones who lingers on.
So once again we wind up in each other's arms, pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight.
I know it's wrong,
But it ain't easy moving on.
So why can't two friends remember the good times once again?
(Fiddle
steel solo)
Tomorrow when I wake up, I'll be feeling a little guilty, a little sad.
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad.
I guess that's what it is and late night calls like this that we try to find
And I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight.
And I may hate myself in the morning,
But I'm gonna love you tonight...
Lee Ann Womack - I'll Think Of A Reason Later
I heard he was gonna marry some girl from Denver
Then my sister came over, had the Sunday paper with her
There was the girl on the social page
Lookin' in love and all engaged
We decided she don't take a very good picture
It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be a stranger who spends all winter
Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later
I drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker
Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seein' her with him tends to enlarge it
It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be a stranger who spends all winter
Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later
Inside her head may lay all the answers
For curin' diseases from baldness to cancer
Salt of the earth and a real good dancer
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later
(Spoken) Well, it was just one tooth
Did I mention I don't particularly care for her?
She makes me sick...
Lee Ann Womack - Mendocino County Line
Counted the stars on the 4th of July
Wishing they were rockets bursting into the sky
Talking about redemption and leaving things behind
As the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
As fierce as Monday morning feeling washed away
Our orchestrated paradise couldn't make you stay
You dance with the horses through the sands of time
As the sun sinks west of the Mendocino County Line
I have these pictures and I keep these photographs
To remind me of a time
These pictures and these photographs
Let me know I'm doin' fine
I used to make you happy once upon a time
But the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
The two of us together felt nothin' but right
Feeling you near immortal every Friday night
Lost in our convictions left stained with wine
As the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
I have these pictures and I keep these photographs
To remain me of a time
These pictures and these photographs
Let me know I'm doin' fine
I used to make you happy once upon a time
But the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
I don't talk to you too much these days
I just thank the lord pictures don't fade
I spent time with an angel just passing through
Now all that's left is this image of you
Counted the stars on the 4th of July
Wishing we were rockets bursting in the sky
Talking about redemption and leaving things behind
I have these pictures and I keep these photographs
To remind me of a time
These pictures and these photographs
Let me know I'm doin' fine
We used to be so happy once upon a time
Once upon a time
But the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
And the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
Lee Ann Womack - Never Again, Again
Never again, again.
Once more I'll let you back in
I know how the story ends
But I can't help myself
You'll break my heart I know
Through my tears I watch you go
Then just like it's always been
I'll say never again, again
Each time you leave
I say I've had enough
But I must be addicted
To your kind of love
I swear to myself
I'm gonna stand my ground
But one look at you
Breaks my defenses down
And here comes never again, again
Once more I'll let you back in
And just like it's always been
I'll say never again, again
And just like it's always been
I'll say never again, again
Lee Ann Womack - Something Worth Leaving Behind
Hey Mona Lisa, who was Leonardo?
Was he Andy Warhol?
You were Marilyn Monroe
Hey Mozart, what kind of name is Amadeus
It?s kinda like Elvis
You gotta die to be famous
I may not go down in history
I just want someone to remember me
I?ll probably never hold a brush
that paints a masterpeice
Probably never find a pen
that writes a symphony
But if I will love then I will find
That I have touched another life
And that?s something
Something worth leaving behind
Hey Midas you say you have the magic touch
That even all that shiny stuff
Someday is gonna turn to dust
Hey Jesus it must have been some Sunday morning
In a blaze of glory
We?re still tellin? your story
I may not go down in history
I just want someone to remember me
I?ll probably never dream a dream
and watch it turn to gold
No, I?ll never lose my life
to save another soul
If I will love then I will find
That I have touched another life
And that?s something
Something worth leaving behind
Hey baby see the future that we?re building
Our love lives on in the lives of our children
And that?s something
Something worth leaving behind
Lee Ann Womack - The Fool
You don't know me but I know who you are
Mind if I sit down
Do I look familiar if I don't well I should
I'm sure you've seen me around
I know you've probably heard my name
Though we've not been introduced
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who's still in love with you
If you've got a minute I'll buy you a drink
I've got something to say
It might sound crazy but last night in his sleep
I heard him call out your name
This ain't the first time he's done it before
And it's hard to face the truth
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who's still in love with you
I know love is a fragile thing
And I'm trying hard to make it last
But it ain't easy holding on to my dream
When he's holding on to the past
Just one more thing before I go
I'm not here to put you down
You don't love him and that's a fact
Girl I've seen you around
But you hold his heart in the palm of your hand
And it's breaking mine in two
'Cause I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who's still in love with you
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who's still in love with you
Lee Ann Womack - The Wrong Girl
You got a great apartment and a real nice car
The job you always wanted, you're ganna go far
You got everything you need in this world, but you got the wrong girl
Everybodys lookin' cause she looks so hot
You don't know it yet, but I know what you got
Go ahead and give it a whirl but you got the wrong girl
If you're lookin for love, you're lookin to hard
You can't see that what you need is right in your back yard
You were blinded by diamonds and you missed a pearl
Yea you got the wrong girl
Does she like fishin, four wheelin in the woods?
Does she get her hands greasy up under neith the hood?
I bet she never listens to Merle
Yea you got the wrong girl
If you're lookin for love, you're lookin to hard
you can't see that what you need is right in your back yard
You were blinded by diamonds and you missed a pearl
You got the wrong girl
Yea you got the wrong girl
Yea you got the wrong girl
You got the wrong girl
Lee Ann Womack - Time For Me To Go
Well it's gettin' late now baby
I really should be gettin' home
If it feels like I've been here to long,
Must be time for me to go
How can we be here together
And still be so alone
If you dont feel the way I do by now
It must be time for me to go
You know I don't really wanna leave
Baby there's no place I'd rather be
Holdin' on but I'm afraid,
But I'm runnin' out of reasons to stay
Well it's gettin' late now baby
And the wind is blowin' cold
If there's nothin' left for us to say
Must be time for me to go
Lee Ann Womack - Why They Call It Falling
It’s like jumping, it’s like leaping
It’s like walking on the ceiling
It’s like floating, it’s like flying
Through the air
It’s like soaring, it’s like gliding
It’s a rocket ship you’re riding
It’s a feeling that can take you anywhere
So why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
I don’t know
There was passion, there was laughter
The first morning after
I just couldn’t get my feet to touch the ground
Everytime we were together
We talked about forever
I was certain it was Heaven
We had found
So why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
I don’t know
But you can’t live your life
Walking in the clouds
Sooner or later
You have to come down
It’s like a knife through the heart
When it all comes apart
It’s like someone takes a pin
To your balloon
It’s a hole, it’s a cave
It’s kinda like a grave
When he tells you that he’s found somebody new
So why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Now I know
Now I know
Lee Ann Womack - You've Got To Talk To Me
How will I ever know what you're feelin'
How will I ever know what to do
If you simply refuse to tell me
What's goin' on inside of you
Have a little faith in me
Baby can't you see
You've got to talk to me
How can I even know how to help you
How can I ever know what to say
If every time your heart is hurtin'
You turn from me and walk away
Have a little faith in me
Baby can't you see
You've got to talk to me
No you don't have to lie
Look into my eyes
There's nothin' here but love for you
You don't have to feel alone
Let me share the load
There's nothin' more I'd rather do
I'm the one you can always turn to
I'm the one who will stand by your side
My love for you is forever
You don't ever have to run away and hide
Have a little faith in me
Baby can't you see
You've got to talk to me
Lila McCann - Go Easy On Me
You picked me up at seven
I could see it in your eyes
And halfway through the movie
It was still on both our minds
So why put it off one minute more
Let's do what we wanted to
When I first opened the door
Kiss me now...cause you know you will
Kiss me now...why wait until
The end of the night when it's awkward and shy
And there's so much at stake that we're too scared to try
Kiss me now...why go on like this
Kiss me now...get it over with
I'll make it easy on you
I want you to kiss me now
The way we're both distracted
It makes it hard to talk
This ice is easily broken
If we trust in what we got
Kiss me now...cause you know you will
Kiss me now...why wait until
The end of the night when it's awkward and shy
And there's so much at stake that we're too scared to try
Kiss me now...why go on like this
Kiss me now...get it over with
I'll make it easy on you
I want you to kiss me now
You don't have to ask
You know what I'll say
And who knows what will happen next
If we get it out of the way
Kiss me now...why go on like this
Kiss me now...get it over with
I'll make it easy on you
I want you to kiss me now
Lisa Marie Presley - Dirty Laundry
I make my living off the Evening News
Just give me something-something I can use
People love it when you lose,
They love dirty laundry
Well, I coulda been an actor, but I wound up here
I just have to look good, I don't have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear
Give us dirty laundry
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em all around
We got the bubble-headed-bleach-blonde who
comes on at five
She can tell you 'bout the plane crash with a gleam
in her eye
It's interesting when people die-
Give us dirty laundry
Can we film the operation?
Is the heir dead yet?
You know, the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set!
We need dirty laundry
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're stiff
Kick 'em all around
Dirty little secrets
Dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
We love to cut you down to size
We love dirty laundry
We can do
The Innuendo
We can dance and sing
When it's said and done we haven't told you a thing
We all know that Crap is King
Give us dirty laundry!
Little Big Town - Boondocks

I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
And I can feel
That muddy water running through my veins
And I can hear that lullaby of a midnight train
It sings to me and it sounds familiar

I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
And I can taste
That honeysuckle and it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old camp creek
Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowing

I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
It's where I learned about living
It's where I learned about love
It's where I learned about working hard
And having a little was just enough
It's where I learned about Jesus
And knowing where I stand
You can take it or leave it, this is me
This is who I am
Give me a tin roof
A front porch and a gravel road
And that's home to me
It feels like home to me

I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole
Five-card poker on a Saturday night
Church on Sunday morning

You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole
(Down in the boondocks)
Five-card poker on a Saturday night
Church on Sunday morning
Say a little prayer for me

Little Big Town - Good As Gone
There's a cold feelin'
Runnin' up and down my spine
It seems to say
We're Just Wastin'Time
It's like a bad movie
One I wish I'd never seen
The plot gets old, Do you know what mean?
Don't try to tell me it ain't what it is
Chorus:
I'm Good
I'm good at seein' the signs
I'm good at reading between the lines
No use in hangin' on
'Cause you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone
On a lost highway
I don't know how I got where I am
Take the next splitsville exit ramp
It's like a cheap vacation
One I thought we planned very well
Now we've checked out of the lovely love hotel
Don't try to tell me it ain't what it is
Chorus:
I'm Good
I'm good at seein' the signs
I'm good at reading between the lines
No use in hangin' on
'Cause you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone
Don't try to tell me it ain't what it is
Chorus:
I'm Good
I'm good at seein' the signs
I'm good at reading between the lines
No use in hangin' on
'Cause you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone
Baby I'm gone, I'm gone
Lonestar - Amazed
Everytime our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
is almost more than i can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel howmuch you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
i can see your dreams
Chorus:
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you, it just keeps getting better
i wanna spend the rest of my life, with you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby i'm amazed by you
The smell of you skin
the taste of your kiss
the way you whisper in the dark
your hair all around me, baby you surround me
you touch every place in my heart
oh, it feels like the first time everytime
i wanna spend the whole night in your eyes
Chorus
Every little thing that you do
i'm so nove with you
it just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life, with you by my side
forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
oh, every little thing that you do
baby i'm amazed by you...
Lonestar - Class Reunion (That Used To...)
Well I rolled into town
With the ragtop down
I was looking for that homecoming queen
That three-by-nine lit hotel sign read
Welcome back class of '83
There were football guys twice their size
Cheerleaders hiding the grey in their hair
The names were the same but the faces had changed
I didn't recongize anyone there
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh, that used to be us
I had a drink with some buds
Played a lot of catch up
Danced with my date from the prom
But as hard as I tried until I closed my eyes
Everybody I knew was gone
There was Mr. Finch, he taught English and French
He was dancing with a couple of canes
And that homecoming queen, yeah the girl of my dreams
She didn't even remember my name
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
As I stand here and look around
I can't help but wonder
Who will we be ten years from now
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh that used to be us
That used to be us
That used to be us
Lonestar - I'm Already There
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
And when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
And said
Daddy when you coming home
He said the first thing that came to his mind
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there
She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes
I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there
We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there
Oh I'm already there
Lonestar - Let's Be Us Again
Tell me what I have to do tonight,
Cause I

Sorry for the way I lost my head,

Lonestar - Mr. Mom
Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and kiss and that's too bad
She said I can go to work until you find another job
I thought I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hand working dad to being Mr. Mom
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast, six naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long and it's only Monday
Mr. Mom
Football, soccer and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And there's that shopping list she left
That's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any maid can take
Being Mr. Mom
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time
Breakfast, six naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long and it's only Monday
Mr. Mom
Before I fall in bed tonight
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds
I'm gonna look just one more time
'Cause
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the eighteenth time
Breakfast, six naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
Oh been crazy all day long and it's only Monday
Mr. Mom
Balancin' checkbooks, juggling bills
Thought there was nothing to it
Baby, now I know how you feel
What I don't know is how you do it
Lonestar - My Front Porch Looking In
Oh yeah
Yeah oh yeah
The only ground I ever owned was sticking to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch and this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up
With rays of glowing sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences
Like that's where it was hung
My blessings are in front of me
It's not about the land
I'll never beat the view
From my front porch looking in
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them
And the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in, yeah
I've traveled here and everywhere
Following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air
Brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining 
                      sea
But I can't wait to get back home
To the one he made for me
It's anywhere I'll ever go and everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them
Yeah the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in
I see what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them
Yeah the view I love the most
Oh, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in
Yeah
Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk
(From my front porch looking in)
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah
And the most beautiful girl
(Beautiful girl
From my front porch looking in)
Holding both of them
Oh, yeah
Lonestar - Walking In Memphis
Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy - won't you look down over me
Cause I got a first-class ticket
And I'm as blue as a boy can be
Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel
Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
There's a pretty little thing
Waiting for
The King
Down in the Jungle Room
Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
Do I really feel the way I feel
They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
You've got a prayer in Memphis
Now Muriel plays the piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said
Tell me are you a Christain
I said
Ma'am I am tonight
Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel
Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel
Walking in Memphis
Lonestar - You're Like Coming Home
Ridin' restless under broken sky,
Weary traveller, somethin' missin' inside,
Always lookin' for a reason to turn around.
Desperate for a little peace of mind.
Just a little piece of what I left behind:
Well, I found it now: you're like coming home.
You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky.
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road.
You're like coming home;
You're like coming home, all right.
Go head an' let your hair fall down.
This wanderlust: it's gone now.
I'm here in your arms; I'm safe from the road again.
These are the days that can't be erased:
Baby, there isn't a better place;
You're like heaven: you're like coming home.
You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky.
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road.
You're like coming home;
You're that innocence, that serenity,
That long-lost part of me.
You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
A midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky.
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road.
You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky.
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road.
You're like coming home, yeah.
You're like coming home;
Baby, like coming home;
You're like coming home.

Martina McBride - Concrete Angel
She walks to school with the lunch she packed
Nobody knows what she's holdin' back
Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen and lace
The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearing the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel
Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbors hear, but they turn out the lights
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When morning comes it'll be too late
[Repeat Chorus]
A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot
[Repeat Chorus]
Martina McBride - God's Will
I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves
It hid the braces on his legs at first
His smile was as bright as the August sun
When he looked at me
As he struggled down the driveway
It almost made me hurt
Will don't walk too good
Will don't talk too good
He won't do the things that the other kids do
In our neighborhood
I've been searchin', wonderin', thinkin'
Lost and lookin' all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been readin', writin', prayin', fightin'
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I new God's Will
Will's mom had to work two jobs
We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when
Hey Jude
was his favorite song
At dinner, he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world, but him
I've been searchin', wonderin', thinkin'
Lost and lookin' all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been readin', writin', prayin', fightin'
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will
Before they moved to California
His mother said,
They didn't think he'd live
And she said,
Each day that I have him, well, it's just another gift
And I never got to tell her, that the boy showed me the truth
In crayon red, on notebook paper
He'd written,
Me and God love you
I've been searchin', prayin', wounded, jaded
I guess I would be still
Yeah that was until...
I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves
Martina McBride - How Far
There's a boat, I could sail away
There's the sky, I could catch a plane
There's a train, there's the tracks
I could leave and I could choose to not come back
Oh never come back
There you are, giving up the fight
Here I am begging you to try
Talk to me, let me in
But you just put your wall back up again
Oh when's it gonna end

How far do I have to go to make you understand
I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't
Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are
So I'm gonna walk away
And it's up to you to say how far
There's a chance I could change my mind
But I won't, not till you decide
What you want, what you need
Do you even care if I stay or leave
Oh, what's it gonna be

Out of this chair, or just across the room
Halfway down the block or halfway to the moon
How far do I have to go to make you understand
I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't
Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are
So I'm gonna walk away
And it's up to you to say
YeahI'm gonna walk away
And it's up to you to say how far
Martina McBride - In My Daughter's Eyes
In my daughter's eyes I am a hero
I am strong and wise and I know no fear
But the truth is plain to see
She was sent to rescue me
I see who I wanna be
In my daughter's eyes
In my daughter's eyes everyone is equal
Darkness turns to light and the
world is at peace
This miracle God gave to me gives me
strength when I am weak
I find reason to believe
In my daughter's eyes
And when she wraps her hand
around my finger
Oh it puts a smile in my heart
Everything becomes a little clearer
I realize what life is all about
It's hangin' on when your heart
has had enough
It's giving more when you feel like giving up
I've seen the light
It's in my daugter's eyes
In my daughter's eyes I can see the future
A reflection of who I am and what will be
Though she'll grow and someday leave
Maybe raise a family
When I'm gone I hope you see how happy
she made me
For I'll be there
In my daughter's eyes
Marty Raybon - Mama Knows
Me and Jimmy Crowder and a single cagarette
Crouched down in a stall out in the barn
Three puffs later we were sick as we could get
Prayin we'd get better before we got home
She saw me comin through the back door screen
I knew the minute that she looked at me
Mama knows, Mama knows
Sometimes I think she's got a window to my soul
Mama knows, Mama knows
Even when I think it doesn't show
Mama knows
Me and Becky Johnson ankle-deep in ocean waves
Pants rolled up and hearts out on our sleeves
Both needin more than either one of us could get
That first love left the sweetest memory
Fifteen and shy, didn't tell a soul
How is it Mama never has to be told
I wasn't home when Mama passed away
I didn't get to say I love you
But I've got this feelin'
Mama knows, Mama knows
Sometimes I think she's got a window to my soul
Mama knows, Mama knows
Even when I think it doesn't show
Mama knows
Mama knows
Marty Raybon - Sunday In The South
Millworker houses lined up in a row
Another southern sunday's morning glow
Beneath the steeple all the people had begun
Shaking hands with the man who grips the gospel gun
While the quiet prayer, the smell of dinner on the ground
Fills up the morning air, ain't nothing sweeter around
I can almost hear my mama pray
Oh Lord forgive us when we doubt
Another sacred sunday in the south, alright
A ragged rebel flag flies high above it all
Popping the wind like an angry cannon ball
Now the coals of history are cold and still
But they still smell the powder burning, and they probaly always will
And on the old town square, under the barber shop pole
They sit me up in the chair, when I was four years old
I can almost hear my papa say
Won't you hold still, son, stop squirming around
Another southern sunday's comin' down
I can almost hear the old folks say
You made it big, one day you'll leave this town
Some other lazy sunday, you'll be back around
I can feel the evening sun go down
And all the lights in the houses one by one go out
Softly in the distance, nothing stirs about
And the night is filled with the sound of a whipporwill
Want a sunday in the south, alright
Just another sunday in the south
Oh, another sacred sunday in the south
How I miss them old sweet sundays in the south
I can hear my mama calling, in the south, alright
Oh-oh-oh
In the south
Matraca Berg - The Last Fire
Where'd you get the number
Where'd you get the matches
In a motel room
Were they lying in a drawer with your old
boyscott badges
I think I know the truth
CHORUS:
'Cause the last fire always lights the next one
You burn through lovers like a chain-smokin', sweet talkin', son of a gun
Anything it takes to keep your loneliness on the run
'till the next one comes
And the last fire is ashes in the mornings sun
It's a little bit sad
A little bit tragic
The way oyu run around
And if love was a drug you'd be an addict
You're so afraid to come down
CHORUS:
'Cause the last fire always lights the next one
You burn through lovers like a chain-smokin', sweet talkin', son of a gun
Anything it takes to keep your loneliness on the run
'till the next one comes
And the last fire is ashes in the mornings sun
Oneday you're gonna say goodbye
And someone's gonna take it too well
Maybe even look you in the eye
Like it's a cold day in hell
And you;re the last fire
CHORUS:
'Cause the last fire always lights the next one
You burn through lovers like a chain-smokin', sweet talkin', son of a gun
Anything it takes to keep your loneliness on the run
'till the next one comes
And the last fire is ashes in the mornings sun
McHayes - Tulsa Time
I left Oklahoma drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was goin' on to Arizona, maybe on to California
Where all the people live so fine
My baby said I was crazy, my momma called me lazy
I was goin' to show 'em all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool an' I don't need no more schoolin'
I was born to just walk the line
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well you know I've been through it
When I set my watch back to it
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well there I was in Hollywood wishin' I was doin' good
Talkin' on the telephone line
But they don't need me in the movies and nobody sings my songs
Guess I'm just wastin' time
Well then I got to thinkin', man I'm really sinkin'
And I really had a flash this time
I had no business leavin' and nobody would be grievin'
If I went on back to Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
Cause you know I've been through it
Livin' on Tulsa time
Miranda Lambert - Kerosene

Miranda Lambert - Me And Charlie Talking
Me and Charlie boy used to go walking
Sittin in the woods behind my house
When bein lovers meant a stolen kiss
And holding hands with nobody else around
Charlie said he wanted to get married
But we were only ten so we
d have to wait
He said we
d never let our love run dry
Like so many do these days
So we treat our love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar
With holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off
Oh promises we made when we
d go walkin
That
s just me and Charlie talking
Charlie always said he
d like to leave here
So he turned 18 and left our sleepy town
Letters came and went and I kept waiting
For Charlie to come back
And bring the life he
d found
Funny how time and distance change you
The road you take
Don
t always lead you home
You can start a love with good intentions
And you look up and it
s gone
So we treat our love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar
With holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off
Oh promises we made when we
d go walkin
That
s just me and Charlie talking
Now and then I sometimes think of Charlie
How we thought we knew it all back then
Now I
d give anything to feel love
From a child
s heart again
So we treat our love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar
With holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off
Oh promises we made when we
d go walkin
That
s just me and Charlie
Me and Charlie talking
Montgomery Gentry - Gone
This ain't no temporary, typical, tearful good-bye, uh uh uh
This ain't no breakin' up and wakin' up and makin' up one more time, uh uh uh
This is gone (gone) gone (gone) gone (gone) gone

Well, she's gone
Long gone, done me wrong
Never comin' back, my baby's gone
Lonely at home, sittin' all alone
She's packed her bags and now she's gone
Never comin' back, she's gone
No no never, no no never, no never comin' back
Montgomery Gentry - If You Ever Stop Loving Me
My old man's backhand used to land,
Hard on the side of my head.
I just learned to stay out of his way.
There's been streetfights, blue lights,
Long nights with the world sittin' on my chest:
It just showed me how much I could take.
Hard times, bad luck.
Sometimes, life sucks.
That's all right, I'm ok.
It ain't nothin' but another day.
But only God knows where I'd be,
If you ever stopped lovin' me.
The bank man, the boss man, the lawman,
All tryin' to get their hands on me.
And I ain't even done a danged thing wrong.
I've been waylaid, freight-trained, short-changed,
By bigger an' badder men.
An' all I got to say is:
Bring it on.
Hard rain, rough road,
So my life goes.
That's all right, I'm ok.
It ain't nothin' but another day.
But only God knows where I'd be,
If you ever stopped lovin' me.
I need you,
Gotta have you,
In my life, on my side,
Every day I'm alive,
Every might when I'm greedy an' needing,
You!
Instrumental break.
That's all right, I'm ok.
It ain't nothin' but another day.
But only God knows where I'd be,
If you ever stopped lovin' me.
It ain't nothin' but another day.
But only God knows where I'd be,
If you ever stopped lovin' me.
Baby, never stop lovin' me.
Ah, just see, what your lovin' does to me.
Montgomery Gentry - She Don't Tell Me To
Every now an' then, on my home,
I stop at a spot where the wild flowers grow, an' I pick a few,
'Cause she don't tell me to.
I go out with my boys all right,
But most of the time I call it a night before they do,
'Cause she don't tell me to.
Sunday mornin', I'm in church,
An' my butt an' my back an' necktie hurt, but I'm in the pew,
She don't tell me to.
Any other woman I know would have tried,
To control me and it would be over.
Plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude.
All of that stubborness melts away,
When I wake with her head on my shoulder,
An' I know I've got to love her,
Until my life is through,
'Cause she don't tell me to.
Well, I got demons and I've got pride,
But when I'm wrong, I apologise like she's mine to lose,
'Cause she don't tell me to.
Well, I got dreams in this heart of mine,
But nothin' that I wouldn't lay aside if she asked me to.
'Cause she don't tell me to.
An' she don't even know,
That she keeps lookin' for the next right thing to do,
'Cause she don't tell me to.
Yeah, yeah.
Any other woman I know would have tried,
To control me and it would be over.
Plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude.
And all of that stubborness melts away,
When I wake with her head on my shoulder,
An' I know I've got to love her,
Until my life is through,
What else can I do?
What else can I do?
Whoa, I love her,
'Cause she don't tell me to.
She don't tell me to.
Every now an' then, on my home,
I stop at a spot where the wild flowers grow, an' I pick a few,
Yes I do.
Montgomery Gentry - Something To Be Proud Of
There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he sees an opening
In a conversation about the way things used to be
Well I'd just roll my eyes and make a bee-line for the door
But I'd always wind up starry-eyed, cross-legged on the floor
Hanging on to every word
Man, the things I heard
It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school, uphill both ways
We were cane switch raised, and dirt floor poor
'Course that was back before the war
Yeah, your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say...
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
That's a chin held high as the tears fall down
A gut sucked in, a chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a-flyin'
Or a newborn baby cryin'
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
So I'm graduatin' college, that was mama's dream
But I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned 18
Cuz when you gotta fast car you think you've got everything
I learned quick those GTO's don't run on faith
I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A.
Working maximum hours for minimum wage
Well, I fell in love, next thing I know
The babies came, the car got slow
I sure do miss that old hot rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad, I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well, he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said, lemme tell ya right now
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
You don't need to make a million
Just be thankful to be workin'
If you're doing what you're able
And putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of
And if all you ever really do is the best you can
Well, you did it man
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
That's a chin held high as the tears fall down
A gut sucked in, a chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a-flyin'
Or a newborn baby cryin'
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
Yeah, that's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
Now that's something to be proud of
Montgomery Gentry - You Do Your Thing
put me on a mountain way back in the backwoods
put me on a lake with a big'n on the line
put me round a campfire cookin somethin i just cleaned
you do your thing I'll do mine
i aint tradin in my family's safety
just to save on a little gas
and I'll pray to god any place, any time
and you can bet I'll pick up the phone if uncle sam calls me up
you do your thing I'll do mine

hey I'll worry bout me
you just worry about you
and I'll believe what i believe
and you can believe what you believe to
i aint gonna spare the rod
cause that aint what my daddy did
and i sure know the difference between wrong and right
you know to me its all just common sense
a broken rule a consequence
you do your thing I'll do mine

im gonna keep on workin
make my money the old fashioned way
i dont want a piece of someone else's pie
if i dont get my fill on life i aint gonna blame no one but me
you do your thing I'll do mine
you aint gonna be my judge
cause my judge will judge us all one day
you do your thing I'll do mine

Neko Case - Blacklisted
Fast train
Where do your passengers wait?
What's at the heart of your engine's rage?
To what smooth place at the end of the line
With crackling fires and quiet plains
Do the trees bend down
Fold their limbs round you?
Welcome home faithful one
We forgive you.
Slow down fast train
Slow down fast train
Take me with you
Nicholas Jonas - Dear God
Dear God
I hat to be a bother, but I gotta say
This world is getting crazier with every day
I hope You’ll hear me out now as I stop and pray
Dear God
People take Your words and try to twist ‘em round
I know You can’t be happy with what’s goin’ down
I’m searchin’ for some answers, but they can’t be found
Can You help me out, dear God
Dear God,
Just the other night I heard somebody say
What’s the use believin’ in You anyway
I guess it was just heartache talkin’ through the pain
It’s a cryin’ shame
Dear God,
I know You’re disappointed in the things we’ve done
Can’t they see the truth that they’re all running from
Try to preach You message with a loaded gun
What they thinkin’ of, Dear God
Everybody’s searching for an easy solution
They can’t see beyond, the selfish world they’re living in
Your words of love get lost, in all the confusion
But I still believe, someday You’re gonna speak to me
Dear God,
I know You’ve got a million other calls to take
You’re dealing with a lot of things that just won’t wait
But there is one request that I just gotta make
Dear God
Won’t You send a sign down, just to ease my doubt
I’m trying to hear You, but the silence is so loud
I think I see a rainbow from behind the clouds
And I hear You now, dear God.

Pat Green - Baby Doll
She stops and checks her reflection in a car parked on the corner
She says its hell on me this working down at the diner
Some people say man she was hot back when she was younger
Yeah well she was a dancer when she lived in LA
Well she was someone's baby doll
A beauty queen to someone long ago
For the midnight show
And if you close your eyes
You can hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
Back when all the world was young
She was someone's baby doll
She stops and checks her reflection in the bathroom on her lunch break
She says
I still look good for someone half of my real age
Some people say
Man I bet she still makes love like an earthquake
Yeah but man she ain't easy
she ain't letting you in my friend, my friend
Its time to wake up baby doll
Put your best dress and your high heals on
And dream your gone
When you close your eyes
You can hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
Back when all the world was young
She was someone's baby doll
She stops and calls an old friend from the payphone at the subway
She says I feel like I'm just sitting here wasting my days away
It's time to move on baby doll
And walk away just like you did before
when you wanted more
When you close your eyes
You hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
When she was a younger girl
a pretty heart in a tainted world
Not sure who you wanna be
Your daddy's little drama queen
I hope that when you find yourself
You're more than just a baby doll
Pat Green - Somewhere Between Texas...
You say you love me but you love me not
Something about true love that you must have forgot
To lose a memory I know just where to go
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico

King fish are jumping  the moon is right
Full throttle captain til the we're out of sight
Stars on the ocean will find me I know
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
South Padre Island to the Brownsville Bay
My heart is healing with each breaking way
But I got some real friends and they're ready to go
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico

King fish are jumping the moon is right
Full throttle captain til the we're out of sight
Stars on the ocean will find me I know
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
It's gonna take just a little more time
With a little help from the salt and a lime
Something about the wind and the sea sets a broken heart free out there yeah

King fish are jumping the moon is right
Full throttle captain til the we're out of sight
Stars on the ocean will find me I know
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico

Phil Vassar - I'll Take That As A Yes (The Hot Tub Song)
You like a dozen wine red roses
Candle lights on porcelain set tables
And that's fine
Well, I'll go out of my way for you anytime, that's right
The fire's warm so you take off your sweater
Now it's my turn and I'll do you one better
That's the game we both like to play
You wink, I laugh 'cause we know
A little hug leads to a foot rub
Then a hot tub
Then a French kiss on a bear rug
Do you like it
Do you like it
How about this
Wanna try it?
Oh, oh, oh
I'll take that as a yes
You like snugglin' with your pillow
With my arms tight holdin' us together
Breathin' deep
Driftin' like a feather in a stream
Then I touch you on your shoulder
Feel your skin soft underneath my fingers
And I know we'll never get to sleep
You wink, I laugh 'cause we know
A little hug leads to a foot rub
Then a hot tub
Then a french kiss on a bear rug
Do you like it
Do you like it
How about this
Wanna try it?

There's no mistake, no guess, no doubt
No beatin' around the bush
Baby it's understood

A little hug leads to a foot rub
Then a hot tub
Then a French kiss on a bear rug

Phil Vassar - In a Real Love
I was 18 makin' minimum wage
With a letterman jacket and a Chevrolet
thought I was cool
yeah I ruled the school
You were coolatta with the strawberry lips
Had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips
Our senior year, I was your daddy's worst fear
We ran off on graduation night
Thought a couple of left hand rings would make everything alright
With a little bit o' live, little bit o' learn
Little bit o' watchin' a few more candles burn
And findin' out what life was
With a little bit o' fuss little bit o' fight
Little bit o' kiss and makin' up all night
And wide awake in love, oh in a real love
Well I was 22 workin' double overtime
I was spendin' dollars and makin' dimes
I was overdrawn, barely hangin' on
Then one night you came to me
Tears in your eyes and the EPD and said
guess what
Baby ready or not
Well I just smiled but I was scared to death
How am I gonna' raise a kid when I'm only a kid myself
With a little bit o' live, little bit o' learn
Little bit o' watchin' a few more candles burn
And findin' out what life was
With a little bit o' fuss little bit o' fight
Little bit o' kiss and makin' up all night
And wide awake in love, oh in a real love
Rachel Proctor - Me
&
Emily
Floorboard's filled with baby toys,
An' empty coke bottles an' coffee cups.
Drivin' through the rain with no radio,
Tryin' not to wake her up.
Cell 'phone says
low battery
,
God, what if I break down?
I'm just lookin' for an exit with a lotta lights,
A safe little interstate town.
Just a cheap hotel,
With a single bed,
And cable TV
Is good enough for me an' Emily.
Some day, when she's old enough,
She's gonna start askin' questions about him.
Some kid at school brings his Dad for show an' tell,
An' gets her little mind a-wonderin'
Where's my Daddy? Do I have one?
Does he not love me like you do?
Oh, maybe I'll find someone to love the both of us,
An' I'll tell her when she's old enough to know the truth.
Will it break her heart?
Will she understand,
That I had to leave?
That's what was best for me an' Emily.
That house was never clean enough
his dinner never warm enough.
Nothing I did was ever good enough to make him happy.
So, I guess, he gave me what he thought I deserved,
But it would kill me if he ever raised his hand to her.
Big rigs are throwin' rain on my windshield,
An' I feel like they're laughin' at me.
Fin'lly the storm is lettin' up,
An' the mornin' is breakin' free.
It's a brand new day,
It's a second chance.
Yesterday is just a memory,
For me an' Emily.
Ah.
Floorboard is filled with baby toys,
An' empty coke bottles an' coffee cups.
Least there's one good thing that he gave me,
An' she's startin' to wake up.
Randy Houser - How Country Feels
You were raised on an asphalt farm
Ain't never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up between your toes
You never rolled in the hay
You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on here girl
Let me show you how country feels
Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels
You ever watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
Ever been so into somebody
You're still lying there when it comes back up
Girl what do you say?
Cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels
Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels
Let your hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off (Kick your shoes off)
Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels
Country feels
Randy Travis - Four Walls
My Grandpa farmed for a livin',
Content to live the simpler kind of life.
My Grandma worked in the kitchen,
Awfully proud to be that farmer's wife.
They used to say that they'd got everything that they need,
Each mornin' they wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.
Here I am, ring on my finger:
Grandpa's little grandson, all grown up.
I found my rock and I plan to keep her.
I wish they were here to see the two of us.
They'd proud to know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.
With the highway twice as wide,
And the farmland sub-divided.
It's good to know that some things never change.
I'm still lovin' an I'm still livin',
By those simple words of wisdom:
Life an' love come down to just four things.
My Grandpa, Lord knows, I miss him,
An' the way that he and Grandma looked at life.
And each day, I count my blessings,
To have that kind of love here by my side.
No matter what, we know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.
Yeah, we've got everything that we need,
Between the two of us:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.
Rascal Flatts - Bless The Broken Road
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Rascal Flatts - Dry County Girl
A tall drink of water in a cotton dress
That preacher's daughter, she sure is blessed
As sunlight passes through the fabric so soft
You can imagine what goes through my thoughts
She says there'll be time for all of that
When my dress is white and your suit is black

There's so many fish in the sea
And I know it's a great big world
But I couldn't help but fall in love so hard
For my dry county girl
For my dry county girl, yeah
It's widely known that I have my flaws
While she's the Joan of Arkansas
Her lips won't touch the demon wine
But her eyes are full of pure moonshine
And I get drunk just holding her hand
I get high thinking I could be her man
[Repeat Chorus]
For my dry county girl
Lord, I fell so hard
For my dry county girl
For my dry county girl, yeah
Yeah, talking about my
[Fade]
Rascal Flatts - Falling Upside Down
There's no gravity up here
It's kind of hard to explain
Every time I'm holding you
It's like backwards rain - yeah

You lift me up like a kite on a string
Like a bird on newfound wings
So high on you, I'm floating and flying around
Your love is like fallin' upside down
You've got me so lightheaded
It's a dizzy mood
Spinning uncontrollably
And gaining altitude
[Repeat Chorus]

Look at me
Used to be, I could keep my feet on the ground
When you said you could take me higher
You weren't playing around
(You weren't playing around)
[Repeat Chorus]
Rascal Flatts - Fast Cars And Freedom
Staring at you taking off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone
Chorus:
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes and your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a dogwood branch
That river was cold but we gave love a chance
Yeah To me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset, riverbank, first time feeling
Yeah smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
Got Cougar up on ten, Little Diddy 'Bout Jack and Diane
You're laughing, singing with your feet up on the dash
Remember that
Chorus:
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes and your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a dogwood branch
That river was cold but we gave love a chance
Yeah To me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset, riverbank, first time feeling
Rascal Flatts - Feels Like Today
Woke up this mourning
With this feeling inside me that I can't explain
like a weight that I've carried
Has been carried away, away
But I know something is coming
I don't know what it is
But I know it's amazing, you same me
My time is coming
And I'll find a way out of this life...
It feels like today I know it feels like today I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missin'
The one thing I'm wishin'
Life's sacred blessin'
It feels like today
Feels like today
You treat life like a picture
But it's not a moment frozen in time
It's not gonna wait
Til you make up your mind, at all
So while this storm is breaking
While there's light at the end of the tunnel
Keep running towards it
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache
Soon this daw will break
And it feels like today
I know, it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missin'
The one thing you're wishin'
Life's sacred blessin'
It feels like today
Feels like, feels like your life changes
Feels like, feels like your life changes
It's the one thing that's missin'
The one thing you're wishin'
Life's sacred blessin'
It feels like today
Feels like, feels like your life changes
Feels like, feels like your life change
Rascal Flatts - I Melt
When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle, setting the mood
Well, I just lie there staring
Silently preparing to love on you
Well, I can feel the heat from across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do

I melt every time you look at me that way
It never fails, anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt
Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better
Is knowing that forever you're all mine
The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes
[Repeat Chorus Twice]
Every time you look at me that way
I melt, I melt
Rascal Flatts - Like I Am
Lying here with you
I watch you while you sleep
The dawn is closing in
With every breath you breathe
I can feel the change
The change you've made in me
But will I ever see
All the things you see in me
When you say that I'm one of a kind
Baby, I don't see it but you believe
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you
I'll try to be that kind of man
Because you love me like I am
When it comes to love
I may not know the rules
But there's one thing I know
My heart belongs to you, just you
When you say that I'm one of a kind
Baby, I don't see it but you believe
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you
I'll try to be that kind of man
Because you love me like I am
You show me, you love me
With a fire that burns deep inside
When you say that I'm one of a kind
Baby, I don't see it but you believe
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you
I'll try to be that kind of man
Because you love me like I am
When you say that I'm one of a kind
Baby, I don't see it but you believe
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you
I'll try to be that kind of man
Because you love me like I am
I am
I'll never understand
I don't think I'll ever understand
Why you love me
Why you love me just like I am
Rascal Flatts - Love You Out Loud
I have always been a little shy
I
ve always been the quiet type till now
And I never let my feelings show
I never let anybody know
Just how much I was so deep in love
But now that you
re in my arms
Chorus
I
m gonna stand on a rooftop, climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio, show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know just what I
m all about
I love to love you out loud
You keep bringing out the free in me
What you do to my heart just makes me melt
And I don
t think I can resist
But I
ve never been one to kiss and tell
A love this true can
t be subdued
So I
m gonna let out a yell

Bridge
Baby, I want the whole world to see
Just how good your love looks on me

Baby, I love to love you out loud
Yeah, I love to love you out loud
Rascal Flatts - Mayberry
Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was the day of rest
Now its one more day for progress
But we can't slow down
Cause more is best
All in the process
But I miss Mayberry
Sittin on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke
Where everything was black
white
Pickin on a Six String
People pass by and you call them by their first name
Watching the clouds roll by
bye bye
Sometimes I can hear this whole world stopping
Through the trees as the wind blows
Thats when I climb up here on this mountain
And look through God's window
No I can't fly
I've got to be
To get me high up here
Far from the noise and city streets
My world receives the peace
But I miss Mayberry
Sittin on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke
Where everything was black
white
Pickin on a Six String
People pass by and you call them by their first name
Watching the clouds roll by
bye bye
Sometimes I dream I'm driving down an old dark road
Not even listed on the map
I pass a dad and his son carrying a fishing poll
But I always wake up everytime I try to turn back
But I miss Mayberry
Sittin on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke
Where everything was black
white
Pickin on a Six String
People pass by and you call them by their first name
Watching the clouds roll by
bye bye
Rascal Flatts - My Worst Fear
Last night you gave me a kiss
You didn't know it, but I was awake when you did
You were quiet, you were gonna let me sleep
So I just laid there pretending to be
You said some things you didn't know I could hear
And the words
I love you
never sounded so sincere

It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving
Now that I know just how much you care
You finally gave me one good reason not to go
But staying here is my worst fear
This morning I rolled out of bed
Recalling all the sweet things you said
This was the day I was gonna hurt you bad
Called out your name, but you didn't answer back
I searched the house to find out what was wrong
Like a ton of bricks, it hit me you were gone
[Repeat Chorus]

All along I knew that there was something missing
And only one thing left to do
I had to leave behind this life that we'd been living
But the only thing that left was you
[Second Chorus]
It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving
Now that I know just how much you care
You finally gave me one good reason not to go
But being alone is my worst fear
And staying here is my worst fear
Rascal Flatts - Shine On
I was lost in darkness and sinking sand
Well I was barely nothing, a broken man
But you picked up the pieces of my heart in your hand
Then you came and showed to me love's second chance

Shine on, shine on, shine on me
Whenever something's missing
You're exactly what I need
Your love has shown me the light and now I finally see
So shine on, shine on, shine on me, yeah
Lord knows that I'm not perfect but I sure do try
And I see the man that I can be in your eyes
Well there are times I still get lost in yesterday
But you put the past behind me and you light my way
[Repeat Chorus]
Shine on (let your love shine)
Shine on (on me)
Shine all your love on me, yeah
(Your love on me)
Shine all your love on me, yeah
[Repeat Chorus]
Shine on, shine on, shine on me
Won't you keep on shining, yeah
Won't you keep on shining your love
Down on me, baby
Won`t you keep on shining, yeah
Won`t you keep on shining your love
Yeah, you're exactly what I need, baby
Yeah, you are
Rascal Flatts - Skin
Sarah Beth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well
Since the day that she fell
And the bruises just won't go away
So she sits and see waits with her mother and dad
Flips through an old magazine
Till a the nurse with a smile
Stands at the door
And says will you please come with me
Sarah Beth is scared to death
Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white
Something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you
Six chances in ten it won't come back again
With the therapy were gonna try
It's just been approved
It's the strongest there is
I think we caught it in time
Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind in blowing her hair
Sarah Beth is scared to death
As she sits holding her mom
Says it would be a mistake
For someone to take
A girl with no hair to the prom
Oh, just this morning right there on her pillow
Was the coolest of any surprise
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
The proof that she couldn't deny
Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around without any cares

Rascal Flatts - These Days
Hey baby, is that you
Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah I love it, I really do
Norma Jean,
ain
t that the song we
d
                        sing
In the car driving downtown
Top down, making the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheny Avenue
Yeah, life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me, I swung and I missed
And the next thing you know, I
m reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams
Wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again
Chorus
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job, guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home, check the phone just in
                      case
Go to bed, dream of you
That
s what I
m doing these days
Yeah, that
s what I
m doing
Someone told me after college
You ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow, that ain
t the girl I knew
Me, I
ve been a few places
Mostly here and there once or twice
Still sorting out life but I
m doing alright
Yeah, it
s good to see you too
Well hey girl you
re late
And those planes, they don
t wait
But if you ever come back around
This sleepy old town
Promise me you
ll stop in
To see an old friend
And until then
(Repeat Chorus Twice)
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then

Rascal Flatts - Too Good Is True
I guess it's cause and effect
Your heart and mine
The way that we connect
Keeps blowing my mind
There you go again, it never ends
What you do to me

That I have seen the light of day
Love is finally going my way
Is it too good to be true
Give me one more kiss, one more touch
Baby, I just can't get enough of you
This time, too good is true
All of a sudden
I'm not who I used to be
I had my heart locked
But you held the key
And you find a way, everyday
To show me even more
[Repeat Chorus]

Some people say we're too good to be true
But they don't get to be loved by you
[Repeat Chorus]
Oh this time, too good is true
Yes it is, yeah
Rascal Flatts - You

Every road that I've been down
The only truth that I have found
There's only one thing I can't live without
You
I was searching for something I thought I would never
                      find
Losing my mind
In and out of bad love, I thought I was born to lose
Then came you
I thought I knew what the real thing was
But nothing shakes me like your love does
I've been hypnotized
Now I realize
[Repeat Chorus]
Every time I get lost in a temperamental mood
You still stay cool
Just when I think that this life's about to drive me insane
You take the reins
Every time I feel I'm drifting off course
You're my compass, you're my one true north
In a mixed up world
You make sense to me girl
[Repeat Chorus]

Yeah, every road girl
Leads me to you
And baby, that's all I need to know
[Repeat Chorus Twice]
Every road that I've been down in my life
Every time I feel I'm taking off
Every road that I've been down in my life
Every road girl, leads me to you
Yes it did, yes it did
Every road girl
Every road leads me to you
[Fade]
Reba McEntire - He Gets That From Me
His early mornin' attitude:
You have to drag him out of bed.
Only frosted flakes will do,
He gets that from me:
Yeah, he gets that from me.
His curly hair and his knobbly knees:
The way the sun brings those freckles out.
Talk and talk, never miss a beat,
Yeah,he gets that from me:
He gets that from me.
He looks at me with those big brown eyes:
He's got me in the palm of his hands,
And I swear sometimes it's just like you're here again.
He smiles that little crooked smile:
There's no denying he's your child.
Without him I don't know what I'd do:
He gets that from you:
Oh, he gets that from you.
How he loves your old guitar:
Yeah, he's taught himself to play.
He melts my heart: tells me he love me every day.
And cracks jokes at the perfect time,
Makes me laugh when I want to cry.
That boy is everything to me:
He gets that from you:
He gets that from you.
Last night, I heard him pray:
Lord, help me and mama make it through.
An' tell Daddy we'll be okay:
He said he sure misses you:
He sure misses you.
He really misses you:
He gets that from me.
Reba McEntire - I'm Gonna Take That Mountain
I'm gonna take that mountain.
I was born a stubborn soul.
Ain't afraid of the great unknown,
Nor the windin road thats all uphill.
This is just a stumblin' block;
Intimidating wall of rock.
If you think this broken heart will break my will.

Ain't nothing gonna slow me down.
And there ain't no way around it.
Gonna leave it level with the ground.
Ain't just gonna cross it,climb it, fight it:
I'm gonna take that mountain.
It's overwhelmin', lookin' up.
An' knowin' it's the challenge of me,
Against this heartache to survive.
I may slip an' I may fall,
But even if I have to crawl,
I'll break through to the healin' side
I'm gonna take that mountain.

Reba McEntire - My Sister
Hey girl it's me i just called to tell you hi
Call me when you get this
Haven't talked lately so hard to find the time
Give the boys a big kiss
Tell them that I miss them
By the way I miss you too
I was thinking just today
About how we used to play
Barbie dolls and make-up
Tea parties dress up
I remember how we'd fight
We made up and laughed all night
Wish we were kids again
My sister my friend
Oh yeah before I forget I met someone
I think I really like him
I was wondering if I'm jumping the gun
By going out on a limb
And invite him home for Christmas
To meet the family
Seem like just yesterday
You brought home old what's his name
He had been drinking
What were you thinking
After dinner he passed out
We can laugh about it now
We've learned a lot since then
My sister my friend
Do you think you could come and see me sometime soon
We could just hang out like we used to
It's late and I should go
But I can'y hang up the phone
Until I tell you
What I don't tell you enough
Even though at times it seemed
We were more like enemies
I'd do it all again
My sister my friend
Reba McEntire - Somebody
At a diner down on Broadway they make small talk
When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life
And tells her he's 'bout ready to give up
That's when she says,
I've been there before
But keep on lookin' 'cause maybe who you're lookin' for is...
Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody
Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one maybe he could fall in love with
Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody
Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they'd both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waiting on
Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there
Oh somewhere out there is somebody
Rebecca Lynn Howard - That's Why I Hate Pontiacs
Wisteria vines were covered:
Every sunset was a watercolor;
Had the promise of a perfect summer.
A blue-eyed boy with a red TransAm:
We spent hours on his hood just laughin',
In between the moonlight dancin'.
An' it was way too short but oh, so sweet.
Don't know what it was to him but it was love to me.
That's why I hate Pontiacs:
Black vinyl seats and crackerjacks with plastic rings.
They play it back, that goodbye scene on a warm September night.
That's why I hate river roads with the windows down,
And Tupelo: oh, I hate that town,
'Cause all I know is that's where he was bound,
And he never did come back.
That's why I hate Pontiacs.
I filed away my wounded pride.
I found someone and loved again:
Never take a trip to way back when.
'Til the radio plays a certain song,
And it's like a finger on the trigger:
Some old hurts they just hurt bigger.
I might have gotten past it long ago,
But parts of yesterday, they get tattooed on your soul.
That's why I hate Pontiacs:
Black vinyl seats and crackerjacks with plastic rings.
They play it back, that goodbye scene on a warm September night.
That's why I hate river roads with the windows down,
And Tupelo: oh, I hate that town,
'Cause all I know is that's where he was bound,
An' he never did come back.
That's why I hate Pontiacs.
That's why I hate Pontiacs.
That's why I hate Pontiacs
Black vinyl seats: we were maniacs: so wild and free,
Till he took it back: that he loved me and he drove off like the wind.
That's why I hate Scorpios: you can't tie 'em down,
And Tupelo: Lord, I hate that town,
'Cause all I know is that's where he was bound,
An' he never did come back.
That's why I hate Pontiacs.
That's why I hate Pontiacs.
Rockie Lynne - Lipstick
Well, enough
Of this nonsense, baby
We're bigger than this
Let's get back to us
And the thrill we felt with our first kiss
You know the road can take us
Out where we both feel so alive
Let's go tonight
You can put your lipstick on while I drive
Chorus:
We can go down to old El Paso
Spend the night in New Orleans
Go out to California like we've always dreamed
Makin' love out in the desert
I can watch the sunset in your eyes
Let's go tonight
You can put your lipstick on while I drive
(You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
(While I drive)
Well, I'm tired
Of this life we're livin'
Dreamin' dead-end dreams
Like a worn-out ol' shag carpet frayin' at the seams
You know we got to change it
No waitin' 'til the time is right
Let's go tonight
You can put your lipstick on while I drive
Chorus:
We can go down to old El Paso
Spend the night in New Orleans
Go out to California like we've always dreamed
Makin' love out in the desert
I can watch the sunset in your eyes
Let's go tonight
You can put your lipstick on while I drive
(You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
(While I drive)
Bridge:
Let me touch you
Let me love you
Let your heart race next to mine
Chorus:
We can go down to old El Paso
Spend the night in New Orleans
Go out to California like we've always dreamed
Makin' love out in the desert
I can watch the sunset in your eyes
Let's go tonight
You can put your lipstick on while I drive
(You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
(While I drive)
Rodney Atkins - Honesty (Write Me A List)
He said:
Just think it over, and write me a list,
So we can figure out what we both deserve.
She hardly could believe it, that their love had come to this:
Dividing an' deciding his and hers.
But she grabbed a paper napkin, an' asked the waitress for a pen.
An' one by one, she wrote down what she wanted most from him.
Honesty, sincerity, tenderness and trust.
A little less time for the rest of the world,
And more for the two of us.
Kisses each mornin', 'I love you's' at night,
Just like it used to be.
The way life was when you were in love with me.
She reached across the table an' placed it in his hand,
An' said:
You know this isn't easy for me.
As he thought about the new car, the house an' the land,
An' wondered what that bottom line would be.
An' a thousand other things that she'd want him to leave behind,
But he never dreamed he'd open up that napkin and find:
Honesty, sincerity, tenderness and trust.
A little less time for the rest of the world,
And more for the two of us.
Kisses each mornin', 'I love you's' at night,
Just like it used to be.
The way life was when you were in love with me.
Well, he fought back the tears, as he looked in her eyes,
An' said:
I don't know where to start.
An' she said:
Everything on that list in your hand,
Is hidden somewhere in your heart.
Honesty, sincerity, just like it used to be.
The way life was when you were in love with me.

Rushlowe - Sweet Summer Rain
Three or four miles down a red dirt road,
An' a green-eyed girl an' I used to go to see her.
I'd pull up the drive an' she'd jump in,
An' we'd head off down around the bend to the river.
Find a perfect spot an' throw a blanket on the ground:
Sit there talkin', till the sun went down, about nothin'.
Then one hot day in June,
The clouds rolled in right out of the blue.
As we ran for cover, I could smell her perfume,
In that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
Oh, that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
We were jumpin' an' a-runnin' an' a-laughin' out loud.
The sky opened up like the bottom fell out of Heaven, yeah.
We dove in the car, turned the radio on,
Sat there soakin', singing along with Elton, Bennie And The Jets.
She turned an' looked my way,
Those raindrops slowly runnin' down on her face.
I reached out an' kissed her,
Well, I remember that taste
Of that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
Oh, that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
Sweet summer rain: it keeps blowin' through my mind.
Even after all this time,
I can't forget that moment,
Yeah, we were fallin':
Just like that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
Yeah, that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
Oh, that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
Yeah, that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
(I still remember,)
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
To fade.
Sara Evans - A Real Fine Place To Start
I'm gonna do it darlin':
I could waste time tryin' the figure it out,
But I'm jumpin' in anyhow.
I've never been this far;
Didn't know love could run so deep:
Didn't know I'd lose this much sleep.
Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon.
Spinnin' all night,
Lovin' just who you are:
Sparks flyin' in the dark.
Shootin' out lights, huntin' down dreams,
Figurin' out what love really means:
Baby, givin' you my heart,
Is a real fine place to start.
Somethin' is goin' on,
I can't explain but sure can touch:
It's callin' both of us.
Stronger than any fear or doubt,
It's changin' everything I see:
It's changin' you, it's changin' me.
Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon.
Spinnin' all night,
Lovin' just who you are:
Sparks flyin' in the dark.
Shootin' down lights, runnin' down dreams,
Figurin' out what love really means:
Baby, givin' you my heart,
Is a real fine place to start.
Right here, right now's the perfect spot, the perfect time.
The perfect moment when your skin is next to mine.
Instrumental break.
Yeah, yeah:
Holdin' you close, (Holdin' you close.)
Chasin' that moon. (Chasin' that moon.)
Spinnin' all night,
Lovin' just who you are:
Sparks flyin' in the dark.
Shootin' out lights, (Shootin' down lights.)
Runnin' down dreams, (Runnin' down dreams.)
Figurin' out just what love really means:
Baby, givin' you my heart's a real fine place,
Real fine place to start.
Oh yeah.
Oh, oh, oh.

If you don't take me to Paris
On a lover's getaway
It's all right, it's all right
If I'd rather wear your t-shirt
Than a sexy negligee
It's all right, it's all right
Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit
It's kinda nice to know that it doesn't have to be
Perfect
Baby every little piece
Of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
tattered at the seams
But honey if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me
If your mother doesn't like
The way I treat her baby boy
It's all right, it's all right
If in every wedding picture
My daddy looks annoyed
It's all right, it's all right
Don't you know that all the fairy tales tell a lie
Real love and real life doesn't have to be
Perfect
Baby every little piece
Of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
tattered at the seams
But honey if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me
You don't mind if I show up late for everything
And when you lose your cool it's kinda cute to me
Ain't it nice to know that we don't have to be
Perfect
Baby every little piece
Of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
tattered at the seams
But honey if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me
It's good enough for me (perfect)
Yeah good enough for me (perfect)
Good enough for me (perfect)
Sara Evans - Suds In The Bucket
She was in the backyard - they say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up - a white pickup truck
Her folks shoulda seen it comin' - it was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough - and you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door -
sorry but I got to go
That was all she wrote - her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote - so the story goes
Now her daddy's in the kitchen - starin' out the window
Scratchin' and a rackin' his brains
How could 18 years just up and walk away
Our little pony-tailed girl growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Now don't you wonder what the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morn
Nothin' quite like this has happened here before
Well he must have been a looker - smooth talkin' son of a gun
For such a grounded girl - to just up and run
Course you can't fence time - and you can't stop love
Now all the biddy's in the beauty shop gossip goin' non-stop
Sippin' on pink lemonade
How could 18 years just up and walk away
Our little pony-tailed girl growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
She's got her pretty little bare feet hangin' out the window
And they're headin' up to Vegas tonight
How could 18 years just up and walk away
Our little pony-tailed girl growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Sara Evans - Tonight
If I had a weakness
You sure found it tonight
Some hidden desperation
You saw floatin' in my eyes
Moments just like these baby
Wrong can feel so right
And I don't wanna go home tonight
I've held it all together
As long as I can
There's pieces of me fallin'
Right into your hands
And don't the lies come easy baby
When the truth just ain't worth the fight
No I, I don't wanna go home tonight
So lay me down easy
And hold on tight
And tell me I'm the only one you see tonight
Lonely woman, lonely man
There's just some things only lonely understands
I might be just a sinner
Who wants to be a saint
One justifies the reason
Oh, one understands the pain
And I don't know what's wrong baby
And I sure don't know what's right
But I don't wanna go home tonight
So lay me down easy
And hold on tight
And tell me I'm the only one you see tonight
Scotty Emerick - The Coast Is Clear
Afternoon low tide, workin' my plan.
Got one hand in the water, the other in the sand.
Two beers in a cooler, one warm heart in place.
Got a picture in a bottle, one nailed up to a palm tree.
One out in the wind and they all look like me.
I want somebody to be the feeling's all over my face.
Oh, I've never been more ready than I am right now,
I know sooner or later, someday, somehow,
Somebody's gonna walk up,
An' join somebody sittin' right here.
So wherever, whoever you are,
The coast is clear.
I close my eyes and the sound of the waves,
Carries me forward to better days,
An' they open my eyes to the woman of my dreams strolling in.
With a small touch of shyness an' a smooth kind of style,
She kisses me on the cheek and she says with a smile:
I've been waiting all my life for you, baby. Where have you been?
Oh, I've never been more ready than I am right now,
I know sooner or later, someway, somehow,
Somebody's gonna walk up,
An' join somebody sittin' right here.
So wherever, whoever you are,
The coast is clear.
Girl, wherever, whoever you are,
The coast is clear.
Afternoon low tide, I'm just workin' my plan,
Right now, right here,
The coast is clear.
Oh, yeah.
Shania Twain - Don't
Don't... don't you wish we tried?
Do you feel what I feel inside?
You know our love is stronger than pride... oh
No don't... don't let your anger grow
Just tell me what you need me to know
Please talk to me, don't close the door
Hmmm, 'cause I wanna hear you
I wanna be near you
Don't fight, don't argue
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away
Don't tell me to go
Don't!... Don't give up on trust
Don't give up on me, on us
If we could just hold on long enough
Hmmm, we can do it
We'll get through it
Don't fight, don't argue
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away, don't tell me to go
Don't pretend that it's okay
Things won't get better that way
Don't do something you might regret someday...
Don't!
Don't give up on me
Hmm, Don't!
(We can do it) We'll get through it
Don't fight, don't argue
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away, don't tell me to go
Don't! (Don't fight dont argue)
Don't give up on me

Say that that I'm sorry
(Just let me love you)
Don't give up on me

Dont give up on me
(Don't turn me away)
Don't tell me to go...
Shania Twain - Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)
Cool, yeah
You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they're on my tail
I get so aggravated, when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I'm really feeling frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me
And you'll see
Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax
1 - Don't be stupid
You know I love you
Don't be ridiculous
You know I need you
Don't be absurd
You know I want you
Don't be impossible
Oh, oh...
2 - I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Oh,
Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail
Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax, Max
Repeat 1
Oh, oh no no
Repeat 2
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Ow!
Don't be stupid
Oh, ah, oh, ah
You're my baby
Repeat 2
Repeat 1
Impossible
Oh no, no, no
Don't be, don't be, don't be baby
Don't be ridiculous, oh, oh, no, no
Oh don't be stupid
Shania Twain - Forever And For Always
In your arms I can still feel the way you
want me when you hold me
I can still hear the words you whispered
when you told me
I can stay right here forever in your arms
And there ain't no way--
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way--
and there ain't not how

'Cause I'm keeping you
forever and for always
We will be together all of our day
Wanna wake up every
morning to your sweet face--always
Mmmm, baby
In your heart--I can still hear
a beat for every time you kiss me
And when we're apart,
I know how much you miss me
I can feel your love for me in your heart
And there ain't no way--
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't now way--
and there ain't no how
I'll never see that day....
[Repeat Chorus]
(I wanna wake up every morning)
In your eyes--(I can still see
the look of the one) I can still see
the look of the one who really loves me
(I can still feel the way that you want)
The one who wouldn't put anything
else in the world above me
(I can still see love for me) I can
still see love for me in your eyes
(I still see the love)
And there ain't no way--
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way--
and there ain't no how
I'll never see that day....
[Repeat Chorus ]
I'm keeping you forever and for always
I'm in your arms
Shania Twain - From This Moment
(I do swear that I'll always be there. I'd give anything 
                      and everything and I
will always care. through weakness and strength, happiness 
                      and sorrow, for
better, for worse, I will love you with every beat of my 
                      heart.)
From this moment life has begun
From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love I'd give my last breath
From this moment on
I give my hand to you with all my heart
Can't wait to live my life with you
Can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on
You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prrayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment-
I will love you as long as I live
From this moment on
Shania Twain - Honey I'm Home
The car won't start, it's falling apart
I was late for work and my boss got smart
My pantyline shows got a run in my hose
My hair went flat man I hate that (hate that)
Just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress I must confess
This could be worse than PMS

Can't wait til' the end of the day
Hey honey I'm on my way

Shania Twain - It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing
Hope life's been good to you
since you've been gone
I'm doin' fine now - I've finally moved on
It's not so bad - I'm not that sad
I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain - I'm free again

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath to forget
Don't think I'm lyin' 'round cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really all right
I've never looked back as a matter of fact
[repeat chorus]
It only hurts when I breathe
Mmm, no, I've never looked back as a matter fact
[repeat chorus]
Hurts when I'm breathing
Breaks when it's beating
Die when I'm dreaming
It only hurts when I breathe
Shania Twain - Ka-Ching
We live in a greedy little world
that teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly
then turn around and
Spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So it's shoppin' every Sunday at the mall
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store
Chorus:
Can you hear it ring
It makes you wanna sing
It's such a beautiful thing Ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
When you're broke go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when
you get bored
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store
Repeat Chorus
Let's swing
Dig deeper in your pocket
Oh, yeah, ha
Come on I know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Oh
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store
Repeat Chorus
Can you hear it ring
It makes you wanna sing
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
Ka-ching!

(Oh na, na, na)
She hosts a T.V. show--she rides the rodeo
She plays the bass in a band
She's an astronaut--
a valet at the parking lot
A farmer working the land
She is a champion--she gets the gold
She's a ballerina--the star of the show

She's--not--just a pretty face
She's--got--everything it takes
She has a fashion line--
a journalist for
Time
Coaches a football team
She's a geologist--a romance novelist
She is a mother of three
She is a soldier--she is a wife
She is a surgeon--she'll save your life

She's--not--just a pretty face
She's--got--everything it takes
She's--mother--of the human race
She's--not--just a pretty face

Shania Twain - That Don't Impress Me Much
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius--you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all
BRIDGE:
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brain but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve--just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Okay, so you're Brad Pitt
That don't impress me much
So you got the looks but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
C'mon baby tell me--you must be jokin', right!

Okay, so you've got a car
That don't impress me much
So you got the moves but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
You think you're cool but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much
Okay, so what do you think you're Elvis or something...
Whatever
That don't impress me
Shania Twain - Up
It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way--
yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily
Even my skin is acting weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots
not play connect the dots
I just wanna disappear

Up--up--up--
Can only go up from here
Up--up--up--Up
where the clouds gonna clear
Up--up--up--
There's no way but up from here
Even something as simple as
Forgettin' to fill up on gas
There ain't no explanation why--
things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to have a laugh
[Repeat Chorus]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
When everything is goin' wrong
Don't worry, it won't last for long
Yeah, it's all gonna come around
Don't go let it get you down
You gotta keep on holding on
It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing want to go my way--
yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily
[Repeat Chorus]
Oh-- I'm going up [4x]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
Shania Twain - You're Still The One
(Speaking)
When I first saw you, I saw love. And the first time you 
                      touched me, I felt
love. And after all this time, you're still the one I love.
(Singing)
mmm yea, Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We might of took the long way
we knew we'd get there someday
They said, I bet, they'll never make it
but just look at us holding on
were still together, still going strong
~Chorus~
(still the one) You're still the one I run to
the one that i belong to
you're still the one i want for life
(still the one) you're still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you're still the one i kiss goodnight
Aint nothing better
we've beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen

but just look at us holding on

~Chorus~
(still the one) You're still the one I run to

you're still the one i kiss goodnight
I'm so glad we made it
look how far we've come my baby
Shania Twain - You've Got A Way
You've got a way with me
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
I've gotta say, you really got a way, hmm
You've got a way it seems
You gave me faith to find my dreams
You'll never know just what that means
Can't you see, you got a way with me
1 - It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love
You've got a way with words
You get me smiling even when it hurts
There's no way to measure what your love is worth
I can't believe the way you get through to me
Repeat 1
Oh, how I adore you
Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are
Repeat 1
It's just the way you are
Shannon Brown - Corn Fed
We don't flip the bird, we don't cuss an' scream,
When the cars don't move when the light turns green.
We don't lock our doors when we leave the house,
There ain't nobody here that we'd keep out.
That's the way we do it in our town, yeah.
You never hear me apologise,
For growin' up strong, growin' up right.
Livin' life by the Golden Rule.
Say:
Yes, Ma'am,
Thank You.
Green fields for miles an' miles,
Ain't nothin' but country on the radio dial.
I thank the good Lord I was born an' bred,
Corn fed.
Ain't no burnin' flags on our Court House Square.
You see Old Glory flyin' everywhere.
There ain't no Valley joint with five-star atmosphere.
Daddy's home-grown beet's what's for dinner here.
An we wash it down with a tall, cold beer, yeah.
You never hear me apologise,
For growin' up strong, growin' up right.
Livin' life by the Golden Rule.
Say:
Yes, Ma'am,
Thank You.
Green fields for miles an' miles,
Ain't nothin' but country on the radio dial.
I thank the good Lord I was born an' bred,
Corn fed.
Rooster crows, six a.m.;
John Deere pulling that plow again.
Spit on your face, hands in the dirt,
Ain't nothin' better on God's great earth.
You never hear me apologise,
For growin' up strong, growin' up right.
Livin' life by the Golden Rule.
Say:
Yes, Ma'am,
Thank You.
Green fields for miles an' miles,
Ain't nothin' but country on the radio dial.
I thank the good Lord I was born an' bred;
Well, I thank the good Lord I was born an' bred,
Corn fed.
Corn fed.
Corn fed.
Corn fed.
SheDaisy - Come Home Soon
I put away the groceries
And I take my daily bread
I dream of your arms around me
As I tuck the kids in bed
I don't know what you're doin'
And I don't know where you are
But I look up at that great big sky
And I hope you're wishin' on that same
bright star
I wonder, I pray

And I sleep alone
I cry alone
And it's so hard livin' here on my own
So please, come home soon
(Come home soon)
I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I'll wear our lucky penny 'round my neck
Pressed to my heart
I wonder, I pray
[Repeat Chorus]

I still imagine your touch
It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance
I wonder, I pray
[Second Chorus:]
I sleep alone
I cry alone
Without you this house is not a home
So please, come home soon
[Third Chorus:]
I walk alone
I try alone
I'll wait for you, don't want to die alone
So please, come home soon
Come home soon
Come home soon
SheDaisy - Don't Worry 'Bout A Thing
Ever been misunderstood, misused, or misled
Ever knocked on the sky
and had it fall on your head
well, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry
Ever lost your luggage, your marbles,
your house
Or found yourself in bed with Uncle Sam or Mickey Mouse
Ever been accused of murder on Music Row
Or caught in morning traffic when you
really gotta go - Oh no!

Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes your losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Ever sat yourself down when the
seat is all wet
Or see your
ex
sucking face with
a little brunette
Don't worry 'bout it, no don't worry
Ever lost your religion, ever lost your
best friend
Or found your last record in the bargain bin
Or been stuck in a divorce like crazy glue
Or scraped someone else's gum off the
bottom of your shoe - Boo hoo!
[Repeat Chorus]
Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes your losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing
(Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah,
Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah,
Blah)
Don't worry, don't worry

We all got a little junk in the trunk
And when you're feelin' good as sunk
Remember, everything will be just fine
If I laugh at yours then you'll laugh at mine
[Repeat Chorus 2x]
Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes your losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing
(Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah,
Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah,
Blah)
Don't worry, don't worry
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes your losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing
(thank you very much)
Shelly Fairchild - Tiny Town

On this telephone line
Everytime we talk I always end up cryin
You

Mamma I can come home but I can

Gotta make a little money tryin
to sing my songs
My hearts still there even though I

I put my roots deep in the ground
Of that tiny town
Of that tiny town
Of that tiny town
Shelly Fairchild - You Don't Lie Here Anymore
There's a king-size bed that ain't been slept in,
Dinner on the table; it's sitting there cold again.
The front porch light just gave up and burned out.
Here you are looking like something the cat drug in,
With a worn out story 'bout a-where you've been:
Sweet little words coming out of your mouth.
You aint gonna lie, lie here anymore.
You ain't gonna break this heart,
Baby, like you did before.
You're a silver tongued devil that had me believin',
Every promise you were bound to break.
But you aint getting back through this door:
You don't lie here anymore.
You can beg and plead an' say that you're innocent;
That you don't know where the time went,
But that trace of perfume is a smokin' gun.
So you can turn right around,
Go back to where you've just been;
Take a look at all you'll be missin',
'Cause you won't be here when the morning comes.
You aint gonna lie, lie here anymore.
You ain't gonna break this heart,
Baby, like you did before.
You're a silver tongued devil that had me believin',
Every promise you were bound to break.
But you aint getting back through this door:
You don't lie here anymore.
Hey, yeah: you're a silver tongued devil that had me believin',
Every promise you were bound to break.
But you aint getting back through this door:
You don't lie here anymore.
You don't lie here anymore.
You don't lie here anymore.
Sherrie Austin - Streets Of Heaven
Hello God, it's me again. 2:00 a.m., Room 304.
Visiting hours are over, time for our bedside tug of war.
This sleeping child between us may not make it through the night.
I'm fighting back the tears as she fights for her life.
Well, it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
She's much too young to be on her own:
Barely just turned seven.
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven?
Tell me God, do you remember the wishes that she made,
As she blew out the candles on her last birthday cake?
She wants to ride a pony when she'd big enough.
She wants to marry her Daddy when she's all grown up.
Well, it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
She's much too young to be on her own:
Barely just turned seven.
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven?
Lord, don't you know she's my angel
You got plenty of your own
And I know you hold a place for her
But she's already got a home
Well I don't know if you're listenin'
But praying is all that's left to do
So I ask you Lord have mercy, you lost a son once too
And it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
Lord, I know once you've made up your mind,
There's no use in beggin'.
So if you take her with you today, will you make sure she looks both ways,
And would you hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven.
The streets of Heaven.
Shooter Jennings - 4th Of July
Alone with the morning burning red in the canvas in my head
Painting a picture of you
And me driving across country, in a dusty old RV
Just the road and its majesty
And I
m looking at you with the world in the rear view
Chorus-
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me ,and your happy to be,
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn
t take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
Those white lines get drawn into the sun if you aint got no one
To keep you hanging on
And there you were like a queen with your nightgown, riding shotgun from town to town
Staking a claim on the world we found
And I
m singing to you, your singing to me ,you were out of the blue to a boy like me
Chorus-
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me ,and your happy to be,
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn
t take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
and im looking for you in the silence that we share
Chorus-
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me ,and your happy to be,
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn
t take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along

Sugarland - Just Might (Make Me Believe)
I got miles of trouble spreadin' far and wide
Bill on the table gettin' higher and higher
They just keep on comin', theres no end in sight
I'm just holding on tight...
I've got someone who loves me more then words can say
And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face
Still hard to find faith..
Chorus:
But if you look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave You just might make me believe
Its just day to day tryin' to make ends meet
What id give for an address on easy street
I need a deep margarita to help me unwind
Leave my troubles behind...
Chorus:
But if you look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave You just might make me believe
I used to believe in use
When times got tough
Lately I'm afraid that even love is not enough
Chorus:
But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave you just might make
Oh, you just might make me
You just might make me believe
Sugarland - Something More
Monday, hard to wake up
Fill my coffee cup, I'm out the door
Yeah, the freeway's standing still today
It's gonna make me late, and thats for sure
I'm running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it there by nine
Chorus:
There's gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm gonna take my chances
Taking a chance I might
Find what I'm looking for
There's gotta be something more
Five years and there's no doubt
That I'm burnt out, I've had enough
So now boss man, here's my two weeks
I'll make it short and sweet, so listen up
I could work my life away, but why?
I got things to do before die
Chorus:
There's gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm gonna take my chances
Taking a chance I might
Find what I'm looking for
There's gotta be something more
Some believe in destiny, and some believe in fate
I believe that happiness is something we create
You best belive that I'm not gonna wait
'Cause there's gotta be something more
I get home 7:30 the house is dirt, but it can wait
Yeah, 'cause right now I need some downtime
To drink some red wine and celebrate
Armageddon could be knocking at my door
but I ain't gonna answer thats for sure.
There's gotta be something more!
Taylor Swift - State of Grace
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (ever) be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I love the shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mostly of broken hearts
But this love is great and wild
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (ever) be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (ever) be the same
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (ever) be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Terri Clark - Better Than You
At a table for two with a romantic view,

And said:

As they walked to her door, he smiled.

She said:

Terri Clark - Girls Lie Too
So she can
t go out tonight again
Her sister
s sick, she
s gotta baby-sit
Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse
Now you didn
t hear any of this from me
But things aren
t always what they seem
Brace yourself, this may come as a shock to you
Girls lie, too
We don
t care how much money you make
What you drive or what you weigh
Size don
t matter anyway
Girls lie, too
Don
t think you
re the only ones
Who bend it, break it, stretch it some
We learn from you
Girls lie, too
We can
t wait to hear about your round of golf
We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall
And we like Hooter
s for their hotwings too
Other guys never cross our minds
We don
t wonder what it might be like
How could it be any better than it is with you

Yeah, girls lie, too
We always forgive and forget
The cards and flowers you never sent
Will never be brought up again
Girls lie, too
Old gray sweatpants turn us on
We like your friends and we love your mom
And that's the truth
Girls lie, too
Yeah that
s the truth
Girls lie, too
[No, we don
t care how much hair you have
Yeah, that looks good
Comb it over like that...
Terri Clark - God
&
Me
Sun
s comin
up on a sunday mornin
.
I
m lookin
out the window at a beautiful view.
Turn on the tv an
somebody
s talkin
,
bout the wrong and the right and the ultimate truth.
I listen for a minute but my heart is somewhere else,
cause I
ve got my own convictions but I keep them to myself.
When I feel the world around me,
How can I not believe?
If I
m high up on a mountain,
Or down on my knees,
It
s just between God and me.
Secrets I
ve been holding.
Tears cried, nobody else sees.
Sometimes I
m alone,
But I know there
s somebody watching over me.
There
s so much I
m afraid of an
I
m really not that strong.
But there
s one place I can go to where all the fear is gone.
When I feel the world around me,
How can I not believe?
If I
m high up on a mountain,
Or down on my knees,
It
s just between God and me.
Every picture
s painted differently.
Every one has got a vision in their mind.
That fills the heart with answers,
And the missin
piece that we hope to find.
And this is mine.
When I feel the world around me,
How can I not believe?
If I
m high up on a mountain,
Or down on my knees.
When I feel the world around me,
How can I not believe?
If I
m high up on a mountain,
Or down on my knees,
It
s just between God and me.
God and me.
It
s just between God and me.
Terri Clark - I Just Called to Say Goodbye
Boy, I didn
t mean to wake you.
I

But I knew you

,
Now it all-makes perfect sense.
No I haven
t changed my mind,
I just called to say goodbye.
You should see this mountain sunrise,
It looks just the way I dreamed.

If it ain

I just called to say goodbye.
Boy, you know I
m gonna miss you....,
But we both know it
s for the best.

As a safety net.
I bet someday your gonna thank me.
When you finally get a taste of true love.
Baby, what we had was pretty good,
Just not enough.
So here

I just called to say goodbye.

Terri Clark - I Just Wanna Be Mad
Last night we went to bed not talking
Cause we already said to much
I face the wall you faced the window
Bound and determined not to touch
We've been married 7 years now
Some days if feels like 21
I'm still mad at you this morning
Coffee's ready if you want some
I've been up since 5
Thinking about me and you
And I've got to tell you
The conclusion I've come to
Chorus -
I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right I think your wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for awhile
For now you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah that's right I'm being stubborn
No I don't want to go back upstairs
I'm going to leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this
Chrous twice
I just want to be mad for awhile
I just want to be mad for awhile
I just want to be mad for awhile
Terri Clark - I Think The World Needs A Drink
Turned on the TV
More crime in the streets
More trouble in the middle east
And fires out west
Politicians flingin dirt
Got decension in the church
Another law suit in the works
Man you talk about a mess
Too much tension between miss liberty and The eiffel tower
It's about time we all made up at some big Happy hour
I think the world needs a drink
I think enoughs enough
She's been spinnin around so long i'd say She's pretty wound up
Calm down, Sit back, Relax
Tear up the contracts and save the ink
Yeah I think the world needs a drink
I bet we'd get somethin done
Over 2 for ones
Rubbin elbows with the big guns
Wouldn't that be cool
Call all the rich and the poor
The peace keepers and the warlords
We'll cut some deals over nothing more
Than a shot of 90 proof
There ain't nothin wrong a few cold beers Can't iron out
In fact you tell me just when and where and I'll buy the first round
I think the world needs a drink
I think enoughs enough
She's been spinnin around so long i'd say She's pretty wound up
Let's all calm down sit back relax
Tear up the contracts and save the ink
Yeah i think the world needs a drink
Hey let's all calm down, sit back, relax
Tear up the contracts and save the ink
Yeah i think the world needs a drink
Dont you think the world needs a couple Drinks
I know I do
Yeah that's Right
Terri Clark - I Wanna Do It All
I'm sitting in traffic
For the 5th year in a row
Wasting my time
Just to get
Where I do even wanna go
I started jaunting things down
On a krispy kreme sack
Everything I'd do
If I could leave this place
And never look back
I wanna do it all
Visit paris in the fall
Watch the yankee's play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads
Down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition
Lay down the law
I wanna do it all
I want to drink tequila
Down in Tijuana
Say why not
When somebody says
Hey do you wanna
I wanna get my heart broke
Once or twice
Settle down with the love of my life
Rock little babies to sleep at night
I wanna do it all
Visit paris in the fall
Watch the yankee's play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads
Down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition
Lay down the law
I wanna do it all
I wanna stand today
Every now and then
Just doin what I want to do
When I wanna do it
Anytime I wanna do it
I wanna do it all
Visit paris in the fall
Watch the yankee's play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads
Down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition
Lay down the law
I wanna do it all
See Niagara falls
Fight city hall
Feel good in my skin
Beating the odds
With my back to the wall
Trying to rob Peter
Without paying Paul
I wanna do it all
I wanna do it all
I wanna do it all
Terri Clark - Not a Bad Thing
I
m sittin
in this cafe,
People talkin
so loud I can
t hear myself think.
That
s not a bad thing.
The coffee keeps on coming,
The waiter who keeps smilin
as I
m ridin
on a river of caffeine,
An
that
s not a bad thing.
I used to feel sorry for someone like me,
In a corner booth pretendin
to read on a friday night.
I used to say:
it just ain
t right.
How could anybody ever have any fun,
Without somebody, without someone?
It never dawned on me,
The possibility,
That it
s not a bad thing.
Those naggin
thoughts about you,
How I left without you tonight:
You know, they
re few and far between.
The waiter
s name is joey, he told me,
And that
s when I noticed he ain
t wearing any ring.
An
that
s not a bad thing.
And there is a tug on the edge of my heart,
It
s you again sayin
:
don
t you start lettin
go of me.
But I ain
t listenin
.
For once in my life, I
ll feel what I feel,
Let it be, let it be real.
Let it flow through me,
An
wash me clean.
That
s not a bad thing.
As I
m drivin
home, I
m thinkin
,
The worst might be over,
Or maybe I
m a little bit naive.
But the street lights seem brighter,
As I walk to my front door,
And I
m all alone when I turn the key.
An
that
s not a bad thing.
I used to feel sorry for someone like me,
In a corner booth pretendin
to read on a friday night.
I used to say:
it just ain

It never dawned on me,

Terri Clark - She Didn't Have Time
He said goodbye from the edge of the porch
like she'd been some casual friend
he said
your better off with out me
i'm not what you need
like her momma had said about him
he started the car
pulled out of the drive
didn't waste any time lookin' back
she watched him go
thinkin' even a stranger
would show more compassion than that
she could've cried but she didn't have time
she had a baby to feed
a pink blanket to find
to rock their little one to sleep
she could've laid in bed for hours
giving misery the power
but she didn't have time
she got a sitter, she got a job
'cause she had a promise to keep
her day was a factory and evening survival
at night was exhaustion and sleep
sometimes she felt life was passing her by
and watching was all she could do
her friends said
you gotta get outta the house
and maybe you'll meet someone new
she could've tried
but she didn't have time
she had a five year old to feed
she had ballet class, piano lessons
and t-ball little league
she could've laid awake for hours
giving lonely nights the power
but she didn't have the time
not time where would she find the time
to trust a man again
not time for that flat tire
a crowded parking lot and then
not time to just have coffee with the man
who got her tired fixed
she was thinking gosh he's handsome
when he asked do you have kids
she could've lied
but she didnt have time
all she said was
she's five
he said
i saw the car seat I love kids
does she have your eyes?
and they sat and talked for hours
giving destiny it's power
she could've been afraid
to fall in love that night
but she didn't have time
she could've been afraid
to fall in love that night
but she didn't have time
Terri Clark - The First to Fall
I
ve had love and love
s had me
I
ve been held and been set free
And I have lived enough to know
That you might stay or you might go
So here I am one more time
Call me brave call me blind
I
m gonna count to 3
I
m gonna hold my breath
Try not to be afraid
Tho it scares me half to death
I
m out here on a limb
Altho I know that it might break
My heart is gonna want you anyway
And if this love has any chance at all
Someone
s gotta be the first to fall
The best is just a touch away
We
ll make forever day by day
It
d be a shame to let this go
How sad to think we
d never know
How the morning light would fall on us
After we make all night in love
I
m gonna count to 3
I
m gonna hold my breath
Try not to be afraid
Tho it scares me half to death
I
m out here on a limb
Altho I know that it might break
My heart is gonna want you anyway
And if this love has any chance at all
Someone
s gotta be the first to fall
So here I am one more time
Call me brave call me blind
I
m gonna count to 3
I
m gonna hold my breath
Try not to be afraid
Tho it scares me half to death
I
m out here on a limb
Altho I know that it might break
My heart is gonna want you anyway
And if this love has any chance at all
Someone
s gotta be the first to fall
Terri Clark - Three Mississippi
I used to believe that things would change but here we go again.
Riding a spinning carousel this circle never ends.
This kitchen table has seen it all before.
These walls are tired of standing, can
t hold us anymore.
1 mississippi I close my eyes.
2 mississippi I
m begging you that we can still survive.
3 mississippi no lookin
back, gone for good and I know that
I won
t change my mind, oh, 3 mississippi is where I
m at tonight.
We
re all out of second chances and all out of one more times.
There
s not a word we haven
t said nothing we have not tried.
My bones are aching from the weight I
m holding down.
I took all that I
m taking, I
m breaking, breaking down.
1 mississippi I close my eyes.
2 mississippi I
m begging you that we can still survive.
3 mississippi no lookin
back, gone for good and I know that.
I won

Thomas Rhett - Beer With Jesus
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Heaven knows I’d sip it nice and slow
I’d try to pick a place that ain’t too crowded
Or gladly go wherever he wants to go
You can bet I’d order up a couple tall ones
Tell the waitress put ‘em on my tab
I’d be sure to let him do the talkin’
Careful when I got the chance to ask
How’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me
Do you hear the prayers I send
What happens when life ends
And when you think you’re comin’ back again
I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
If I could have a beer with Jesus
I’d put my whole paycheck in that jukebox
Fill it up with nothing but the good stuff
Sit somewhere we couldn’t see a clock
Ask him how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me
Have you been there from the start
How’d you change a sinner’s heart
And is heaven really just beyond the stars
I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
He can probably only stay, for just a couple rounds
But I hope and pray he’s stayin’ till we shut the whole place down
Ask him how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me
What’s on the other side?
Is mom and daddy alright?
And if it ain’t no trouble tell them I said hi
I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Tim McGraw - Angry all the Time
Intro:

Here we are, what is left of a husband and a wife
With four good kids who have a way of getting on with their 
                      lives
It's too late to keep from going crazy
I've got to get away
Chorus
The reasons I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being 
                      in love
I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this 
                      rough
And you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left 
                      you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time

Our boys are strong now, the spitting image of you when 
                      you were young
I hope someday they can see past what you have become
And I remember every time I said I'd never leave
But what I can't live with is memories of the way you used 
                      to be
Chorus
The reasons I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being 
                      in love
I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this 
                      rough
And you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left 
                      you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time

Twenty years have came and went since I walked out of your 
                      door
I never quite made it back to the one I was before
And god it hurts me to think of you for the light in your 
                      eyes was gone
And sometimes I don't know why this old world can't leave 
                      well enough alone
Chorus
The reasons I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being 
                      in love
I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this 
                      rough
And you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left 
                      you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
Tim McGraw - Back When
Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Don't happen much anymore
We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played them all
Country, soul and rock-and-roll
What happened to those times?
I'm readin' Street Slang For Dummies
Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
Give me a flat top for strumming
I want the whole world to be humming
Just keep it coming
The way it was back then
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
Tim Mcgraw - Do You Want Fries With That?
I thought that was your voice
I thought that was my car
Now we ain't ever met before
But I know who you are
You're living in my house
And I'm living in a tent
And don't laugh, this second job of mine
Is paying both our rents
You're out here buying Happy Meals
And I'm eating rice and pintos
You so much as crack a smile at me, man
I'll come through this here window
Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the
cat
Yeah I think that's just about everything
Oh I almost forgot
Do you want fries with that?
Your ketchup's in the bag
And a check is in the mail
I hope your chicken's raw inside
And I hope your bun is stale
I'm supposed to tell you
Please come back
But how bout this instead?
I hope you both choke on a pickle
Man, that would tickle me to death
I don't know what you're waiting on
You're holding up the line
Oh man, you ain't got no change coming back
Are you out of your mind?
Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the
cat
Yeah I think that's all there is
Do you want fries with that?
Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the
cat
Yeah I think that about covers it
Do you want fries with that?
Tim McGraw - Grown Men Don't Cry
I pulled into the shopping center
And saw a little boy wrapped
Around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting
They embraced
Years of bad decisions
Running down her face
All morning I'd been
Thinking my life's so hard
And they wore everything
They owned living in a car
I wanted to tell 'em
It would be OK
But I just got in my suburban
And I drove away
I don't know why they say
Grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say
Grown men don't cry
I keep having this dream
About my old man
I'm 10 years old and
He's holding my hand
We're talking on the front porch
Watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream
He was a slave to his job
And he couldn't be around
So many things I wanna say to him
But I just placed
A rose on his grave
And I talked to the wind
I don't know why they say
Grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say
Grown men don't cry
I'm sitting here with
My kids and my wife
And everything that
I hold dear in my life
We say grace and
Thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it's up the stairs and
Off to bed and my little girl
Says I haven't had my story yet
Everything weighing on my mind
Disappears just like that
When she lifts her head
Off her pillow and says
I love you Dad
I don't know why they say
Grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say
Grown men don't cry
Tim McGraw - Live Like You Were Dying
He said I was in my early forties
with a lot of life before me
when a moment came that stopped me on a dime
and I spent most of the next days
looking at the x-rays
Talking bout the options
and talking bout sweet time
I asked him when it sank in
that this might really be the real end
how's it hit you when you get that kinda news
man what'd you do
and he said
I went sky diving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu
and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
and he said someday I hope you get the chance
to live like you were dying.
He said I was finally the husband
that most the time I wasn't
and I became a friend a friend would like to have
and all the sudden going fishin
wasn't such an imposition
and I went three times that year I lost my dad
well I finally read the good book
and I took a good long hard look
at what I'd do if I could do it all again
and then
I went sky diving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu
and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
and he said someday I hope you get the chance
to live like you were dying.
Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about
what'd you do with it what did you do with it
what did I do with it
what would I do with it'
Sky diving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu
and then I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
and I watched an eagle as it was flying
and he said someday I hope you get the chance
to live like you were dying.
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
Tim McGraw - My Old Friend
My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I wouldn't trade them for gold
Cause they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
Their woven in the stories I have told
And tell again
My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There's always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend
Don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why
My old friend, this song's for you
Cause a few a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Cause the love and the laughter
Will live long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We'll meet again, my old friend
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My old friend, my old friend
Goodbye, goodbye
Tim McGraw - Real Good Man
Girl you've never known no one like me
Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man
I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man
I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wild
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man
I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Cept to do the best I can
I'll be damned
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man
I may be a real bad boy
Oh but baby I'm a real good man
Yes I am
Tim McGraw - Red Rag
I was twenty and she was eighteen.
We were just about as wild as we were green,
In the ways of the world.
She picked me up in that red ragtop,
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops on a
                      summer night.
Running all the red lights.
An' we parked way out in a clearing in a grove,
And the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove: we were
                      cooking with gas.
Ooh, it had to last
In the back of that red rag top,
She said:
Please don't stop.
Well the very first time her mother met me,
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be for two weeks.
I was out of a job and she was in school.
And life was fast and the world was cruel, we were young
                      and wild.
We decided not to have a child.
So we did what we did and we tried to forget.
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets in the
                      morning light.
But all the way home that night:
On the back of that red ragtop,
She said:
Please don't stop loving me.
We took one more trip around the sun,
But it was all make believe in the end.
No, I can't say where she is today.
I can't remember who I was back then.
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins.
And there's no such thing as what might have been, that's
                      a waste of time.
Drive you out of your mind.
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday.
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet, and her eyes were green.
And I was in an old scene.
I was back in that red ragtop,
On the day she stopped loving me.
I was back in that red ragtop,
On the day she stopped loving me.
Tim McGraw - She's My Kind Of Rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night
She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are
So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Oh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain
Tim McGraw - Watch The Wind Blow By
The creek goes ripplin' by
I been barefootin' all day with my baby
Brown leaves have started fallin'
Leadin' the way
I like it best just like this
Doin' nothin' all the way
So let's lay down in the tall grass
Dreamin' away

And all I wanna do is let it be
and be with you and watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me
go on forever like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only you and I
And all I wanna do is watch the wind blow by
Girl, you know you told me not so long ago
To let it come, then let it pass
And all your troubles and your sorrows
They won't last
So let me kiss you now little darlin'
Beneath this autumn moon
Cold winds, another season
Will be here soon

All I wanna do is watch the wind blow by
All I wanna do is watch the wind blow by

Raise a daughter and a son,
Be a lover to their mother,
Everything to everyone.
Up and at 'em bright and early,
I'm all in my business suit,

When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right,
I'm out here on the front lines, sleep in peace tonight.
American soldier, I'm an American,
An American,
An American Soldier

Toby Keith - Baddest Boots
I saw her turn her head
In a drop-dead gaze
She was peekin' out over the top
Of those wire-rim shades
Now it wasn't my charm
And it wasn't my grin
That had that little secretary
Dialed right in
She wasn't lookin' at me, man
she was lookin' at my feet

It's these twenty-two hundred
And twenty-five dollar
Pair o' handmade genuine fine
Horned-back kicks
With a seven-row stitch
And a three dollar sidewalk shine
Yeah they're made to fit
and they're hard to find
Make a pretty woman look down each time
I got the baddest boots on the boulevard
Yeah the baddest boots on the boulevard
They were made by a little man
Down in El Paso
I was passin' though town
Singin' at the rodeo
He said 'they cost a little more
But for what it's worth
There ain't another pair like 'em
on god's green earth'
Then I handed him my money
And he sized me up

I got the baddest boots on the boulevard
Yeah, the Baddest boots on the boulevard
When I pull 'em on I start singin' a song
Make me wanna tuck my britches leg's inside 'em
Lets take a stroll

They're the baddest boots on the boulevard
Look here girl
Yeah, they're bad alright
Toby Keith - Beer For My Horses
(Feat. Willie Nelson )
Well a man come on the 6 o
clock news
Said somebody
s been shot, somebody
s been
                      abused
Somebody blew up a building
Somebody stole a car
Somebody got away
Somebody didn
t get too far yeah
They didn
t get too far
Grandpappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree, round up all of them bad boys
Hang them high in the street for all the people to see that
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we
ll sing a victory tune
We
ll all meet back at the local saloon
We
ll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We
ve got too much corruption, and crime in
                      the streets
It
s time the long arm of the law put a few more in 
                      the ground
Send
em all to their maker and he
ll settle
em down
You can bet he
ll set
em down
cause
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we
ll sing a victory tune
We
ll all meet back at the local saloon
We
ll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we
ll sing a victory tune
We
ll all meet back at the local saloon
We
ll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
Toby Keith - Big Blue Note
See that big blue note,
Over there on the counter?
You don't wanna read that thing, man,
It's a real get-you-downer.
But don't you dare say nothin' else,
Bad about her: she's gone.
No, no, no, no, don't, don't throw it away,
'Cause tonight, I might need it.
It gets real lonely around here at night some times,
An' I have to read read it.
Besides, you can show it to the boys down town,
They won't believe that she's gone.
There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted.
All the man that she'll ever need.
I come home to find, just like that, she's up an' vanished.
An' the only thing she left behind for me:
Is this big blue note,
Folded up in my pocket.
Yeah, don't laugh: it's been two months;
I still got it.
Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice,
Just to make sure I ain't forgot that she's gone.
You know, my psychiatrist said:
Tell me, what do you see,
When you look at these inkspots,
Of, er, reds, yellows an' greens?
You know, I looked at 'em all,
But they all looked to me like big blue notes.
There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted.
All the man that she'll ever need.
I come home to find, just like that, she's up an' vanished.
An' the only thing that's left to do for me:
Is stand high on this cliff,
Overlooking the sea.
With my big blue notepaper aeroplane,
That I just set free.
An' I'm gonna wait here a few more minutes,
An' if it don't come back to me:
You guessed it: she's gone.
Crash landing.
Bye bye, baby.
Toby Keith - Country Comes to Town
Well the weatherman said it might storm today
I gotta hit the field
Gotta bail some hay
And I can't let it rain on my daddy's farm
Til I get it all stacked up high in the barn
And I'm gonna call my baby
She's been waiting on me
She lives down town on Sycamore Street
And the wheels on the black top
A startin' to whine
As I pass that Oklahoma City limit sign
I'm a hayseed
And a plow boy
I'm a farm kid
And a cowboy
I'm a roughneck
My daddy was a roughneck too
I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town
Well her Daddy said child you better let him be
Well I don't like him and he sire don't like me
Momma just says ya'll have a little fun
Ain't doin' nothing me and papa ain't done
Open up the door to my pick-up truck
And my baby jumps in and she fires it up
And she gives me a kiss
As I crawl in
We've been waiting all week for a weekend
I'm a hayseed
And a plow boy
I'm a farm kid
And a cowboy
I'm a roughneck
My daddy was a roughneck too
I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town
Yeah it's true I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
Cause that's when country comes to town
Here I come
Toby Keith - Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue
American girls and American guys, will always stand up and salute.
We'll always recognize, when we see ol' glory flying,
There's a lot of men dead,
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our heads.
My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye,
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died.
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me.
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free.
Now this nation that I love is fallin' under attack.
A mighty sucker-punch came flying in from somewhere in the back.
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye,
Man, we lit up your world like the fourth of July.
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list,
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist.
And the eagle will fly and it's gonna be hell,
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell.
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you.
Ah, brought to you, courtesy of the red, white and blue.
Instrumental break.
Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage:
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage.
An' you'll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A.
'Cos we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way.
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list,
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist.
And the eagle will fly and it's gonna be hell,
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell.
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you.
Ah, brought to you, courtesy of the red, white and blue.
Oh, oh.
Of the red, white and blue.
Oh, hey, oh.
Of my Red, White and Blue.

Toby Keith - Get Drunk And Be Somebody
Yeah the big boss man, he likes to crack that whip
I ain't nothing but a number on his timecard slip,
I give him 40 hours and a piece of my soul,
Puts me somewhere at the bottom of his totem pole,
Hell I don't even think he knows my name...

Well all week long I'm a real nobody,
But I just punched out and its paycheck Friday,
Weekends here, good God almighty,

Yeah, yeah, yeah...
My baby cuts hair at a beauty boutique,
Just blowin' and goin' till she dead on her feet,

Toby Keith - Go With Her
Yeah, Daddy said,
Son I'm sorry
You and Sheila ain't getting along
And if she's so dea set on leaving you, boy
Why ain't she already gone
Yeah, you better break out some sweet talking
'Cause I promise you you're gonna miss her
And I know what I'd do
If my baby left me
Pack up my things and go with her.

You don't stay with the one you can live with
It's the one that you can't live without
It's the one that's got you tore up in pieces, boy
It's the one you keep talking about
Pride's a tough pill to swallow
It'll leave you lonely and cold and bitter
So what you need to do
If she's gonna leave you
You better pack up and go with her
Daddy said,
Son, I'm through preaching
I've said all I'm gonna say
Now if you love her as much as I think you do
You're a fool if she gets away
She can go anywhere that she wants to
Dont give up, no don't quit her
Do like I did when your momma left me
Hell, I just packed up and went with her.

You don't stay with the one you can live with
It's the one that you can't live without
It's the one that's got you tore up in pieces, boy
It's the one you keep fretting about
Pride's a tough pill to swallow
It'll leave you lonely, cold and bitter
What you need to do
If she's gonna leave you
Pack up your things and go with her

You don't stay with the one you can live with
It's the one that you can't live without
It's the one that's got you tore up in pieces, boy
It's the one you keep crying about
Pride's a tough pill to swallow
It'll leave you lonely, cold and bitter
What you need to do
If she's gonna leave you
Better pack up and go with her
Yeah, I know what I did
When my baby left me
I packed up my things and went with her
Toby Keith - Honky Tonk U
My grandmother owned a night club
On the Arkansas-Oklahoma line
Mama put me on a Greyhound
And I went to stay with her in the summertime
I'd box up those empty long-necks
And stack 'em in the back and make a ham
Then at night she'd let me sneak out
Of the kitchen and let me sit in with the band
Yes, I have sacks and quarterbacks
And broke my share of bones along the way
I knew it wouldn't last forever
Semi-pro always means semi-payed
I started climbing drilling rigs
I'm oil field trash and proud as I can be, yeah
Then I took my songs and guitar
And sang 'em for a man from Tennessee
I've played every beer joint tavern
From New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out every basketball arena
Like to get down with my boys
In Afghanistan and Baghdad City too
I am a red, white and blue blood
Graduate of Honky Tonk U
A star can't burn forever
And the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
But the glass won't ever be
Half empty in my optimistic mind
I'll still have a song to sing
And a band to turn it up and play it loud
As long as there's a bar room
With a corner stage and a honky tonk crowd
I've played every beer joint tavern
From New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out every basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys
In Afghanistan and Baghdad City too
Son, I'm a red, white and blue blood
Graduate of Honky Tonk U
Toby Keith - How Do You Like Me Now?
I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valadictorian so
Under your number I wrote
call for a good time
I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud.
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now,
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standin here today?
I couldnt make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?
When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Aint it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and tore them apart.
He never comes home
And youre always alone
And your kids hear you cryin down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin
Who could that be singin
Its me baby, with your wake up call!
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now,
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standin here today?
I couldnt make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?
Tell me baby...
I will preach on...
Toby Keith - I Can't Take You Anywhere
(Toby Keith/Scotty Emerick)
You've been a part of my life for so very long
It's hard for me to believe sometimes that you're really gone
I tuck your memory away in that special hiding place
Hoping no one could tell by the look on my face
That you're still in my heart, always on my mind
Part of my everyday
Like just last night I went out for a bite
I tried to have fun with all of my might
But even the laughter, it wasn't much of a break
'Cause right in the middle of my salad and steak
Bobby Joe walked in with a couple of friends
And said,
Hey have you heard from her at all man like
Where's she been?
And it, struck a nerve
And it, hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
And this broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me
But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
Are you comin' back again, I swear
I can't take you anywhere
So I left all alone, just headed back home
As I listened to the messages on my telephone
There was one from my sister
And one from an old friend
He said,
I drove by your house tonight dude but
You weren't in
Just checkin' up on you boy, I hope you're doin' alright
Oh by the way man, I seen her last night
And it, struck a nerve
And it, hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
And this broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me
But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
Are you comin' back again, I swear
I can't take you anywhere
I swear, I can't take you
Just can't take you
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere

Toby Keith - I Love This Bar
We got winners; we got losers;
Chain smokers and boozers.
An' we got yuppies; we got bikers;
An' we got, thirsty hitchhikers.
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars:
Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar.
We got cowboys; we got truckers;
Broken hearted fools and suckers.
An' we got husslers; we got fighters;
Early birds and all nighters.
And the veterans talk about their battle scars:
Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar.
I love this bar,
It's my kind place.
Just walk in through the front door,
Puts a big smile on my face.
It ain't too far; come as you are.
Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar.
I've seen short skirts; we've got high-techs;
Blue collar boys and rednecks.
An' we got lovers; lots of lookers;
I've even seen dancin' girls and hookers.
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar:
Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar, yes I do!
I like my truck, (I like my truck),
An' I like my girlfriend, (I like my girlfriend),
I like to take her out to dinner;
I like a movie now and then:
But I love this bar,
It's my kind place.
Just toeing around the dance floor,
Puts a big smile on my face.
No cover charge; come as you are.
Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar.
Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I just love this ol' bar.

We talk about the troubles you've been having with your brother
About your daddy and your mother and your crazy ex-lover

Toby Keith - If I Was Jesus
If I Was Jesus, I'd have some real long hair
A robe and some sandals, is exactly what I'd wear
I'd be the guy at the party, turnin' water to wine
Yeah me and my disciples, we'd have a real good time.
Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (woooooh)
And I show you who's the boss (woooooh)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hangin' on your cross
If I Was Jesus.
I'd have some friends that were poor
I'd run around with the wrong crowd, man I'd never be bored
Then I'd heal me a blind man, get myself crucified
By politicians and preachers, who got somethin' to hide.
Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (woooooh)
And I show you who's the boss (woooooh)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hangin' on your cross
If I Was Jesus.
If I Was Jesus, I'd come back from the dead
And I'd walk on some water, just to mess with your head
I know your dark little secrets, I'd look you right in the face
And I'd tell you I love you, with Amazing Grace.
Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (woooooh)

Toby Keith - My List
Under an old brass paperweight is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store, put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet
Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Pick up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin', that's the next thing on my list
Wouldn't change the course of fate but cuttin' the grass just had to wait
'Cause I've bot more important things like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today
Like go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Pick up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin', that's the next thing on my list
Raise a little hell, laugh 'til it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start livin', that's the next thing on my list
Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today
Toby Keith - Nights I Can't Remember, Friends I'll Never Forget
Me and JB and Sonny, we grew up on the buddy plan
Weren't we some bad mothers, closer than brothers
Had a rockin' little three-piece band
Yeah we wrote a lot of songs about women
Then we tried to sing 'em pretty for the girls
Pushin' everythin' we did to the limit
Livin' right out on the edge of the world.
I recall on summer night at a party
We were sophomores hangin' out by the lake
I got off on some wine with a waitress
Sonny had a girlfriend that just couldn't wait
JB hooked up around midnight
With an ugly girl from up in the city
He downed every can of beer in the cooler
Just tryin' to drink that poor thing pretty.
Hey me and the boys we made a lot of noise
And we, sang all our songs for free
We partied through college, acquired some knowledge
Never did get a degree
We did it our way lookin' back on the good days
There's still not a lot I regret
Nights I Can't Remember, Friends I'll Never Forget.
I grew up and got married, took a job with the FPL
Sonny's got a good life, a baby and a good wife
And everyday he carries the mail
JB is a cross-country trucker
And he called last night from South Carolina
He said I fallen in love with a waitress
That I met at a Waffle House diner.
He said the years seem to roll on faster
Than they did back when we were kids
Then we need us a break from the grindstone
That's exactly what we did.
We put in a phone call to Sonny
Then we stayed out all night long
We drank a few cold ones, then told a few old ones
And sang another verse to the song.
Yeah we were boys who made a lot of noise
And we, sang all our songs for free
We partied through college, acquired some knowledge
Never did get a degree
We did it our way lookin' back on the good days
There's still not a lot I regret
There's some Nights I Can't Remember, with Friends I'll Never Forget.
All those Nights I Can't Remember, Friends I'll Never Forget.
Toby Keith - Rock You Baby
Met you in a caf
At a table meant for two
You were sitting by your lonesome
When I sat down with you
Tried hard not to show it
But I couldn
t help but see
That you wore your broken heart out on your sleeve
And your loneliness could not disguise
The beauty and the charm
Thought if I ever get you, shattered lady, in my arms
I
m gonna rock you baby to sleep
I
m gonna make you crazy over me
I
m gonna hold you like you
ve never been held 
                      before
And love you till you tell me you can
t love anymore
I
m gonna shake your emotion right down to your soul
And then I
m gonna love you all over in and out of 
                      control
If this is how love is supposed to feel
Baby I know I
ve fallen head over heels
I
m gonna rock you baby
Over open conversation and a bottle of red wine
You said this world is full of users and I know that I
ve 
                      had mine
We danced a little slow dance until they closed that caf
down
You said
what would be the chances that tonight I 
                      finally found
Someone who makes me feel like my life is just begun?
I said
girl believe in me and I
ll show you 
                      how it
s done
I
m gonna rock you baby to sleep
I
m gonna make you crazy over me
I
m gonna hold you like you
ve never been held 
                      before
And love you till you tell me you can
t love anymore
I
m gonna shake your emotion right down to your soul
And then I
m gonna love you all over in and out of 
                      control
If this is how love is supposed to feel
Baby I know I
ve fallen head over heels
I
m gonna rock you baby

Toby Keith - Should've Been a Cowboy
I bet you've never heard ole Marshall Dillion say
Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away
Settling down will you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please
She'd of said Yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart wasn't in it
Stole a kiss as he road away
He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place
I should've been a Cowboy
I should'be learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter riding by pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girl's hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
I should've been a cowboy
I might of had a side kick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west yound man, haven't you been told
California's full of whisky, women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the Texas stars
Dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart
I should've been a Cowboy
I should'be learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter riding by pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girl's hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
I should've been a cowboy
Toby Keith - Stays In Mexico
His name was Steve,
Her name was Gina,
(spoken) You've never been here before have you?
They met at a bar called Cowboy Outcove Cantena,
He was a salesman from South Dakota,
She was a first grade school teacher Pheonix Arizona,
(Spoken) No, My first time here
They started dancing and it got real hot,
Then it spilled over to the parking lot,
One more tequila then we're falling in love,
One night together in Love

Don't bite off more than you can chew,
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do,
Just remember when you let it all go,
What happens in Mexico,
Stays in Mexico
He woke up in the morning and he made a little tellephone call,
To check on his wife and his kids back at home in Souix Falls,
She hopped right in the shower with a heavy heavy mind,
(spoken) What am I doing?
He knew it was the first time Geena had ever crossed that line,
They walked down to the beach and started drinking again,
Jumped into the ocean for a dirty swim,
One more margarita then we're falling in love,
One night together in love

Don't bite off more than you can chew,
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do,
Just remember when you let it all go,
What happens in Mexico,
Stays in Mexico
Oh Mexico
Waiting at the bar at the terminal gate,
She says 'Steve I gotta go, I'm going to miss my plane'
He said one more tequila before you climb on up,
She said more night together in love

Don't bite off more than you can chew,
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do,
Just remember when you let it all go,
What happens in Mexico,
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico,
Stays in Mexico,
Stays in Mexico,
Oh Mexico
Toby Keith - Sweet
She came through the front door lookin' fast as a big train
Bookin' down the line
And she was lookin' fine
Long and lean and dressed to kill
Stacked up high with perfect wheels
and there ain't no chance, that girl would ever dance with me
She got all those city boys pushin' and shovin'
A counrty boy like me don't ever get no uptown lovin'
She's Sweet, she's got 'em melting in her hand
Whoever gets a taste of that cup of sugar
Sure is a lucky man
She's sweet, tellin you boys
She's babelicious, I can't reach that Georgia peach
But she sure looks delicious
I had nothing else to do
So I threw down two more shots of booze
And it made me strong
I strapped my courage on
I said 'would you like a drink?
'By chance, no what I mean is would you like to dance with me?
Please.' in my best southern ease
It got hot on the dance floor when she whispered in my ear
'I think I found my county boy, let's get out of here.'
I said 'sweet'.
I'm melting in her hand
I feel like a spoon in a cup of blonde sugar
Y'all looking at the lucky man
I said 'sweet'
mmm boys she's babelicious
That Georgia peach is now in my reach
And don't she look delicious?
Look here now, she's sweet
I'm melting in her hand
I feel like a spoon in a cup of blonde sugar
Y'all looing at the lucky man
She's sweet, mmm boys she's babelicious
That Georgia peach is now in my reach
And don't she look delicious?
She's sweet.
Toby Keith - The Taliban Song
I'm just a middle-aged, middle-eastern camel herdin' man
I got a, 2 bedroom cave here in North Afghanistan
Things used to be real cool and they got out of hand when they moved in
They call themselves the Taliban
(ooooo yeah the taliban) (taliban baby)
Now I ain't seen my wife's face since they came here
They make her wear a scarf over her head that covers her from ear to ear
She loves the desert and the hot white sand
But man she's just like me, nah she can't stand
The Taliban (ooo taliban baby)
You know someday soon we're both gonna saddle up and it'll be
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smilin right by my side
We should do just fine down in Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip the finger to the Taliban
(oh yeah the taliban) (baby)
Now they attacked New York City cause they thought they could win
Said they would, stand and fight until the very bloody end
Mr Bush got on the phone with Iraq and Iran and said
Now, you
knuckle-heads you better not be doin any business with the taliban
(Taliban baby)
So we prayed to Allah with all of our might
And then those big U.S. jets came flyin one night
They dropped little bombs all over our holy land
And man you should have seen em run like rabbits, they ran
(the taliban)
You know someday soon we're both gonna saddle up and it'll be
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smilin right by my side
We should do real fine down around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair audo and flip a couple fingers to the Taliban
(oh yeah, taliban)
we'll bid a fair adieu and flip a finger to The Taliban (baby)
Toby Keith - Time For Me To Ride
Ain't got no tricks up my sleeve
Ain't got no reason to believe
I've been looking for a sign
Love shouldn't be so hard to find
I've been sleeping on your couch
Just been layin' here alone.
I've been doing without
Oh, you've been doing me wrong
Nothing left here to decide
I think it's time for me to ride...

Put my bike out on the highway
Feel that wind all in my face
Breathe some air that tastes like freedom
Yeah, let that be my saving grace
Somebody loved, somebody lied
I believe it's time for me to ride
Should've known right from the start
I couldn't tame your faithless heart
I could see the writing on the wall
I've never been the kind to crawl
Girl you're never satisfied
I believe it's time for me to ride

Somebody loved, somebody lied
I believe it's time for me to ride
Toby Keith - Weed With Willie
I always heard that his her was top shelf
Lord I just could not wait to find out for myself.
Well don't knock it till you've tried it.
And I've tried it my friend.
I'll never smoke Weed with willie again!
Now we learned a hard lesson in a small Texas town
He fired up a fat boy and he passed it around
The last words I spoke before they tucked me in
I may discount Bungee jump but,
I'll never smoke weed with Willie again.

I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
My party's all over before it begins
You can't pour me some old whiskey River my friend.
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
We hopped on his old bus the Honeysuckel Rose
The party was Huntsville, but it was after the show
Alone in the front lounge, just me and him
I took one friendly puff and the grim creeper set in

Now we're passin' the guitar, we're tellin' good jokes
I can tell one's a comin' 'cause I'm smellin' smoke
No I do not partake I just let it pass by
With a grin on my face and a great contact high

In the fetal position with drool on my chin
We broke down and smoked weed with Willie again
Toby Keith - Whiskey Girl
Don't my baby look good in them blue jeans?
Tight on the top with a belly button ring
A little tatoo somewhere in between
She only shows to me
Hey we're going out dancin' she's ready tonight
So damn good-lookin' boys it ain't even right
And when bar tender says for the lady
what's it gonna be?
I tell him man...

She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose
And, she can't stand the thought of sippin' champagne
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in taquilla
She needs somethin' with a little more edge and a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
My Ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough
Baby got a '69 mustang
four on the floor, and you ought to hear the pipes ring
I jump behind the wheel and it's away we go
Hey, I drive too fast, but she don't care
Blue bandana tied all up in her hair
Just sittin' there singin' every song on the radieo

Whoa she's my little whiskey girl
my raggid-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough
Yeah, I like 'em rough
I like 'em rough

Toby Keith - You Ain't Much Fun
I used to come home late and not a minute too soon
Barking like a dog, howling at the moon
You'd be mad as an ol' red hen, up all night wonderin' where I been
I'd fall down and say come help me honey
You laughed outloud, I guess you thought it was funny
I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
Now I'm paintin' the house and I'm mendin' the fence
I guess I gone out and lost all my good sense
Too much work is hard for your health
I could've died drinkin', now I'm killing myself
Now I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's honey do this, honey do that
I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
Now I'm fixin' the sink and I'm mowin' the grass
You made me a list and I'm bustin' my...wheel
All broke down, tail's been (or talespin??) draggin'
It's a tough ol' life up here on the wagon
Now I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's honey do this, honey do that
I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
Yeah, I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
Toby Keith - You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This
I got a funny feeling
The moment that your lips touched mine
Something shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity
You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around
They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this
I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again
Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancing is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
The way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know
You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
And We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around
They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this
I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again
Kiss me again
Trace Adkins - Chrome
Chrome, She can see herself In the shiny grill and the
Wire wheels of a red Chevelle with four on the floor and 
                      the top down
Chrome, zippin' by on an Electra Glide
With dual tail pipes doin' 105 in the broad daylight
On a two-lane headin' outta town
Forget Pink and purple paisleys
little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow
Her favorite color is ..Chrome
Chrome, get her leg up high
on the bumper of my big black Mack truck
With a smoke stack pointed towards the sky
And mud flaps, you know the kind
Chrome,I said hey little girl you sure look nice
Do you wanna ride, I won't bite, she climbs inside
Says hell no, I want to drive
Forget Pink and purple paisleys
little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow
Her favorite color is ..Chrome
It's chrome alright Shiny,nice polished
Chrome, Chrome
Forget Pink and purple paisleys
little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow
Her favorite color is ..Chrome
Her favorite color is...chrome
That girl is all about chrome
She sure loves chrome
Trace Adkins - Honky Tonk Badonkadonk

She might get up and dance again
Ooh, she put her beer down

Throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near 10 ft. tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him outta his chair
Poor ole boy, it ain't his fault
It's so hard not to stare
At that honky tonk badonkadonk

Get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how's she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk
(Aww son)
Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her
You ain't gotta hate her
For workin' that money-maker
Band shuts down at two
But we're hangin' out till three
We hate to see her go
But love to watch her leave
With that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on
Like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee
Shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There outta be a law
Get the Sheriff on the phone

We don't care bout the drinkin'
Barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start a shakin'
When she gets the urge to dance
Drivin' everybody crazy
You think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look but you can't touch
That honkey tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on
Like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee
Shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There outta be a law
Get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how's she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk
That honky tonk badonkadonk
Yeah, that honky tonk badonkadonk
(That's it, right there boys, that's why we do what we do
It ain't for the money, it ain't for the glory, it ain't for the free whiskey
It's for the badonkadonk)
Trace Adkins - Hot Mama
You're doin' all you can to get in them old jeans.
You want that body back, you had at seventeen.
Baby, don't get down; don't worry 'bout a thing.
'Cause the way you fill 'em out, hey, that's all right with me.
I don't want the girl you used to be.
An' if you ain't noticed, the kids are fast asleep,
An' you're one hot mama;
You turn me on, let's turn it up,
An' turn this room into a sauna.
One hot mama,
Oh, whaddya say, baby?
You wanna?
Well, I know sometimes you think that all you really are,
Is the woman with the kids an' the groceries in the car.
An' you worry about your hips an' you worry about your age.
Meanwhile I'm tryin' to catch the breath you take away.
Oh, an' believe me, you still do.
Baby, all I see, when I look at you,
Is one hot mama;
You turn me on, let's turn it up,
An' turn this room into a sauna.
One hot mama,
Oh, whaddya say, baby?
You wanna?
Instrumental break.
I can't imagine me lovin' someone else.

One hot mama;
You turn me on, let's turn it up,
An' turn this room into a sauna.
One hot mama,
Oh, whaddya say, babe?

Trace Adkins - Rough

Ready
Mudgrips - white-tip
Cigar stickin' out of my face
Earnhardt racing sticker on the window
Banged up fender

Work boots - one blue suit
Size too small - don't wear at all
Unless somebody kicks - gets hitched
That's a bitch - makes me itch
Up with sun - off on the run
Makin' money money - cause I wanna have fun
5 o'clock whistle - off like a missle
Got a hot date, girl named Kate
Think's I'm cool - 'cause I shoot straight
Ain't one thing about her fake
She's long and tall - and she goes great with
Cold beer, hot wings

Ain't a pretty boy-toy
I'll rock you steady
Rough and ready
Rough and ready
Yeah...me and my buddies are all alike
Trace Adkins - Songs About Me
I met a guy on the red eye
He spotted my guitar
and said what do you do?
I said, I sing for a living,
Country music mixed with
a little rock and a little blues
He said I'm sorry
but I've never been crazy
'bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
I just looked at him and laughed and said
cause it's songs about me
and who I am
songs about loving and living
and good hearted women and family and God
yeah they're all just
songs about me
songs about me
So I offered him tickets
I said you'll see what I mean
if you show up tonight
he said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try
Then later on when we finished our songs
about scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there
right next to the stage
and he shouted
man you were right
it was like you sang those
songs about me
and who I am
songs about loving and living
and good hearted women and family and God
yeah they're all just
songs about me
songs about me
So I'll just keep on singing
'til I hear the whole world singing those
songs about me
and who I am
songs about loving and living
and good hearted women and family and God
yeah they're all just
songs about me
songs about me
Trace Adkins - Then They Do
In the early rush of morning
Trying to get the kids to school
One's hanging on my shirttail
Another's locked up
In her room
And I'm yelling up the stairs
Stop worrying 'bout your hair
You look fine
Then they're fightin' in the backseat
I'm playing referee
Now someone's gotta go
The moment that we leave
And everybody's late
I swear that I can't wait
'Till they grow up

Then they do
And that's how it is
It's just quiet in the morning
Can't believe
How much you miss
All they do
And all they did
You want all the dreams
They dreamed of
To come true
Then they do
Now the youngest is starting college
She'll be leavin' in the Fall
And Brianna's latest boyfriend
Called to ask if we could talk
And I got the impression
That he's about to pop the question any day
I look over at their pictures
Sittin' in their frames
I see them as babies
I guess that'll never change
You pray all their lives
That someday they will find happiness

Then they do
And that's how it is
It's just quiet in the morning
Can't believe
How much you miss
All they do
And all they did
You want all the dreams
They dreamed of
To come true
Then they do
No more Monday PTA's
No carpools
Or soccer games
Your work is done
Now you've got time
That's all your own
You've been waitin' for so long
For those days to come

Then they do
And that's how it is
It's just quiet in the morning
Can't believe
How much you miss
All they do
And all they did
You want all the dreams
They dreamed of
To come true
Then they do
Tracy Byrd - Drinkin' Bone
Well it's Friday evenin' six o'clock
And all my friends are twistin' off
I'm at the house just turnin' on T.V.
And they all wonder why I've changed
How many times must I explain
It's basic honky tonk anatomy
The drinkin' bone is connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the stayin' out all night long
And she won't think it's funny
And I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone
Hey two plus two is always four
And down is south and up is north
Thirty-two degrees is freezing cold and,
You play with fire you wind up burned
The early-bird gets the worm
But the only thing you really need to know
Is...
The drinkin' bone is connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the stayin' out all night long
And she won't think it's funny
And I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone
Hey sing it with me
Let's make sure you know....
The drinkin' bone is connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected tot he stayin' out all ngiht long
And she won't think it's funny
And I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected the the....
The drinkin' bone is connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the stayin' out all night long
And she won't think it's funny
And I'll wind up all alone

Tracy Byrd - The Truth About Men
We don't like to go out shoppin',
We don't care what's on sale.
We just want to sit with a bag full of chips,
Watchin' the NFL.
When you come over at half-time,
An' say:
Does this dress fit too tight?
We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie,
An say:
Uh, uh: Looks just right.
Well, that's the truth about men.
Yeah, that's the truth about us.
We like to hunt and golf on our days off,
Scratch, an' spit, an cuss.
It don't matter what line we hand you,
When we come draggin' in.
We ain't wrong; we ain't sorry,
An' it's probably gonna happen again.
We hate watchin'
Steel Magnolias
.
We like
Rambo
an'
Die Hard 4
.
Jump up and down like fools when we see the new tools,
At the Home Depot store.
We don't really wanna take you to dinner,
At some fancy restaurant.
The only reason we do is 'cause we know it leads to,
The one thing that we all want.
Well, that's the truth about men.
Yeah, that's the truth about guys.
We'd rather play guitars and work on cars,
Than work on the problems in our lives.
An' though we might say it to you,
Every now and then,
We ain't wrong; we ain't sorry,
An' it's probably gonna happen again.
Well, if you want to know what we're all thinkin',
It's nothing too complex.
It's just somethin' cold for drinkin',
And a whole lot of s-e......
Yes, that's the truth about men.
Yeah, that's the truth about us.
We like to hunt and golf an' drive around, lost,
Scratch, an' spit, an' a whole lot of other disgustin' stuff.
It don't matter what line we hand you,
When we come a-crawlin' in.
We ain't wrong; we ain't sorry,
An' it's probably gonna happen again.
We ain't wrong; we ain't sorry,
An' it's probably gonna happen;
Sure, it's gonna happen;
You know it's gonna happen again.
An' that's the truth about men.
You know it, son.
(Tell 'em how it is Tracy!)
Tracy Lawrence - Paint Me A Birmingham
He was sitting
there, his brush in hand
Painting
waves as they danced, upon the sand
With every stroke, he brought to life
The deep blue of the ocean, against the morning
sky
I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
He said for twenty dollars, I
ll paint you anything
Could you Paint Me A Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch going
all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she
ll be, mine again
If you can Paint Me A Birmingham
He looked at me, with knowing eyes
Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
Picked up a brush, and said to me
Son just where in this picture would you like to be
And I said if there
s any way you can
Could you paint me back into her arms again?
Could you Paint Me A Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch going
all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she
ll be, mine again
If you can Paint Me A Birmingham
Paint Me A Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch going
all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she
ll be, mine again
If you can Paint Me A Birmingham
Oh paint me a Birmingham
Travis Tritt - I See Me
How he got that GI Joe in the church this morning,
I don't know but he ain't listening to the preacher,
Like his mama taught him to.
She's wanting me to cross the aisle,
Go, sit over there with him awhile,
Make him turn around and sit up straight,
Stop playing in the pew.
To watch him is all that I can do.
'Cause I look at him and I see a boy,
An' I see trouble and I see joy.
See innocence and headstrong,
And a heart full of dreams.
An' I look at him and I'm so amazed:
I'm so proud and then so afraid,
That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree.
Yeah, I look at him and I see me.
Already says, when he grows up,
He's gonna have a big ol' truck,
An' I can see him getting stuck on some private property.
He'll take chances, he'll take dare's,
And keep his Momma and me scared to death.
When he goes out at night,
You know, I'll bet we'll never sleep.
I guess I get what my Dad got from me.
Cause' I look at him and I see a teen,
Havin' fun doing stupid things.
I see roadblocks, I see mistakes:
I see heartbreak he can't see.
I look at him an' I'm so amazed:
I'm so proud and then so afraid,
That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree.
Oh, I look at him and I see me.
I look at him and I see me,
Breakin' down one day,
As he packs up all his things,
To move away.
I look at him an' I'm so amazed:
I'm so proud and then so afraid,
That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree.
Yeah, I look at him and I see me.
Trent Willmon - Beer Man
Spent the night with Jim Beam and Johnny Walker Red,
Woke up with a freight train runnin' through my head,
Ohh I'm a beer man...
Bobby's more the wine kind,
Donny does his shots;
Sammy sips martinis,
Willy smokes pot,
but I'm a beer man...
I've done a little steppin' out there on a limb,
but my open mind winds up closed again,
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans,
Simple maybe...
but that's who I am...
Hey I'M JUST A BEER MAN.
Take your caviar and that fish that ain't cooked,
take if off a cracker and throw it on a hook,
I'm a beer man...
Oh and if I was a rich man tell ya what I'd do,
I'd be the same old, plain old, guy you always knew,
just a beer man...
I've done a little steppin' out there on a limb,
but my open mind winds up closed again,
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans,
Call me simple ...
but that's who I am...
Hey I'M JUST A BEER MAN.
Yeah - I've done a little steppin' out there on a limb,
but my open mind winds up closed again,
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans,
Call me simple ...
but I can't change who I am...
Whoa I'M JUST A BEER MAN.
Yeah... I'm a beer man...
Trisha Yearwood - Georgia Rain

Barefoot in the bed 'a your truck
On a blanket lookin' up
Half a moon peekin' down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneakin' out again
Heard the thunder rollin' in
We were fallin' the moment when
It all came pourin' down

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
What I felt for you that day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way
Except for the Georgia rain

Cotton fields remember when
Flash 'a lightnin' drove us in
We were soaked down to the skin
By the time we climbed inside
And I don't remember what was poundin' more
Heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford
As the sky fell in, the storm clouds poured
Worlds away outside

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
All the love we made
Just you and me down that old dirt road
No one saw a thing
Except for the Georgia rain
3rd Verse
Screen door flappin' in the wind
Same ol' house I grew up in
Can't believe I'm back again
After all these years away
You fixed your Daddy's house up nice
I saw it yesterday when I drove by
Looks like you've made youself a real good life
What else can I say
Tag Chorus
The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
The way I loved you to this day
The ol' dirt road's paved over now
Nothin' here's the same
Except for the Georgia rain
Van Zant - Help Somebody
Well grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar,
blue collar of a man...
He came from the school of
you don't need nothin' if you can't make it with your own two hands
He was backwoods, backwards, used words like:
no sir, yes ma'am, by god, I'll be darned, hell yeah I'm American..
and all the years he walked this earth
I swear all he did was work.
He said the devil dreams on an idle horse
so you listen to me squirt..
Don't get too high on a bottle,
and get right with a man.
Fight your fights, find your grace
and all the things you two can't change, and help somebody if you can
Now Granny said sonny
stick to your gun if you believe in something
no matter what
cause it's better to be hated for who you are
Than loved for someone you're not.
She was 5 feet of concrete
New York born and raised on a slick city street.
She'll stare you down, stand her ground,
still kickin' and screamin' at 93
I remember how frail she looked
in that hospital bed
taking her last few breaths of life
and smiling as she said
Don't get too high on a bottle,
just a little syrup now and then,
fight your fights,
find your grace,
and all the things you two can't change
and help somebody if you can,
and get right with a man
I never let a cowboy make the coffee
yeah thats what Granny always said to my Grandad
and he'd say never tell a joke
that ain't that funny more than once
and if you wanna hear God laugh,
tell Him your plans
Don't get too high on a bottle,
get right with a man, son.
fight your fights,
find your grace,
and all the things you two can't change
and help somebody if you can
and get right with a man
and get right with a man

Zona Jones - Two Hearts
I was born a dreamer, seemed like every day
my mind came up with something new.
But this time it’s my heart, with a dream that’s here to stay.
There’s a chance this one might come true.
I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life.
Two hearts, one love.
And I can see you loving me too, sure would be nice.
Two hearts, one love . . . that’s us.
I can see my lucky starts, when I gaze into your eyes.
Twilight’s shadows hold us tenderly.
It’s so easy to imagine, you here by my side
as I turn out the lights and fall to sleep.
I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life.
Two hearts, one love.
And I can see you loving me too, sure would be nice.
Two hearts, one love . . . that’s us.
I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life.
Two hearts, one love.
And I can see you loving me too, sure would be nice.
Two hearts, one love . . . that’s us.
Two hearts, one love.
Two hearts, one love . . . that’s us.
Zona Jones - Whiskey Kind Of Way
I hardly ever think about her.
I seldom say
I can't live without her
,
Till I hold a drink an' sit at the bar.
A sip an' it all goes straight to my heart.
Like that song on the jukebox,
Her memory starts to play.
Guess I still want her,
In a whiskey kind of way.
An' when I'm sober, I say it's over,
She can't get to me.
I'm a million miles away from her memory.
They say the truth comes out when you're drinkin':
I've been drinkin' 'bout her all day.
Guess I still want her in a whiskey kind of way.
I talk, to Joe behind the counter,
And every fool I meet, about her.
I steel my heart to anyone,
Who'll buy a drink for the lonely one.
What ran her off's had her runnin' through my mind all day.
Guess I still need her in a whiskey kind of way.
An' when I'm sober, I say:
It's over,
She can't get to me.
I'm a million miles away from her memory.
They say the truth comes out when you're drinkin':
I've been drinkin' 'bout her all day.
Guess I still love her in a whiskey kind of way.
Oh, don't the truth comes out when you're drinkin':
I've been drinkin' 'bout her all day.
Guess I still love her in a whiskey kind of way.
